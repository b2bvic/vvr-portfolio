## The Challenge: Building Digital Authority for Scientific Innovation

Life Sciences Kentucky, a new scientific incubator initiative, faced the complex challenge of establishing digital presence and authority in the competitive life sciences ecosystem. Led by regional leaders and backed by local government and private wealth, the incubator needed to attract scientists and researchers from across the country to their Kentucky-based facility.
