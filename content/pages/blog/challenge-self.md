A recent discovery about myself took me by surprise...

I've never been one to be satisfied without a challenge. It's something that has been a driving factor in my life since my extreme youth.

The challenge that repeatedly seems to rear its head defining the challenge in such a way that it becomes a tangible goal.

Specificity seems to be the key required to reaching my goals. Without it, I end up with an idea like "build a business" even though I know close to nothing about doing so. (Word to 3005 Media, I was so much closer that I even knew two years ago.)

You see... I haven't exactly been a "success" in my own eyes.¬†

Sure, I have many skills.

Sure, I have taught myself the equivalent of several college degrees.

Sure, I have the strategies that are required when it comes to offering service, value, and results.

But to me... it's not been enough.

Why? Because once the challenge was realized and articulated, I moved beyond caring enough to see it through to its logical conclusion.

Again, none of this makes sense, but when is the mind completely rational? (It's not, don't let it lie to you.)

I've been circling myself around a digital marketing system for the last 5 years. This system has proven itself effective for a Manufacturing Company's Corporate Marketing Department, for $250k+ Profits on Amazon eCommerce, for tripling the Online Audience of a Megachurch, for winning more listings for a Self-Made Realtor, for extracting a curriculum out of a Astronomer (so he may teach others), and the list goes on.

All of these are the predecessors to what I'm currently working on, a Digital Marketing company in a market that's a decade behind the curve when it comes to anything on the internet.¬†

So what's the problem? My first 8 months out here, I was too worried about adjusting to a new environment, feeling out new social circles, and unravelling the work of a fraud who inadvertently roped me into his web of bullshit.

The challenge was laid out for me right there. I just needed to make it. So I did close to nothing else.¬†

It didn't really hit me until I visited California, explaining to all of my friends the tale of my travels and adventures out here that made me realize that being "just a writer" was only a base-skill to everything else that I'm capable of.

This lesson came to me after a particularly painful and intense LSD trip.

As humans, we create versions of ourselves to suit a certain dynamic. Before you disagree, I'm willing to wager you are a different person to your parents, your boss, your elder family, your adolescent family, or to a random person you've met at a bar or on the street.

The challenge becomes knowing how to integrate these different versions of yourself to suit your internal needs, rather than simply the external.

If this doesn't make sense, I'll use an anecdote.

West-Coast California Victor was extremely docile, having been raised to rely on a quick-wit and tempered rage to get me out of trouble (that I often created for myself), I thought it best to take the life of someone that didn't need aggression, didn't need strength. I was living on fruits and killing my body, but my brain had never been faster. I created many opportunities for myself due to this positive and uplifting outlook I carried with me everywhere.¬†

The 'South' North Carolina Victor learned a whole lot about being not just present, but commanding of presence. Reliant upon not just my mind but my body to present the 'idea' of myself before any words were spoken. I learned to carry myself with even more subtlety. I cut my hair, gained 25 pounds through a daily gym regiment & extensive eating, improved my wardrobe, and was quickly learning the benefits of not just being a silent-observer.

Going back to California, I realized that it was more than just the obvious that had changed.¬†

I found myself even more isolated than my first several months in NC.¬†

During the mental break of an acid trip, it dawned on me that I was having counter-culture shock.

I've created out of myself, an island.

A nomad.

It was crippling, until it wasn't.

See, the next challenge becomes, "Every environment I can add onto this experiential 'tool belt' is only going to make me more robust as a person."

I say all that to say this...

It's not enough to recognize a challenge, you must also recognize the parts within yourself that are suited towards the challenge.

You are many versions of yourself within, they are interchangeable at will, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

...

Thank you for reading.

Your friend allways,

Victor.
