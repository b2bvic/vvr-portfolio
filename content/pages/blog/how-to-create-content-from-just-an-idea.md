## It All Begins With Research

To begin creating any piece of content (whether for yourself or a third party), it has to begin with **research.**

You want to make sure that whatever you’re going to be spending your time on is going to actually be relevant to today’s trends, topics, interests, SOMETHING, or you’re going to be dead in the water before you begin.

People tend to get into a bit of **‘paralysis by analysis’** when it comes to these things, but I’ll keep it as simple as possible:

**Any** _idea, fleeting thought, discovered wisdom, personal anecdote, self-realization, self-motivation, koan, lesson, or parable,_ can be turned into a piece of content. **That content could take the form of writing, visual, video, or even a podcast.**

**Once you’ve come up with something that interests you, it’s time to make sure it will interest others.**

## Trends Are Your Friend

Luckily for you, the internet has many options for those who search. Search Engines track the ‘relevancy’ and connected-ness of different **_keywords_**, by becoming familiar with what others are searching, you’re increasing the chances that **your** content is going to be consumed.

Attention is the name of the game. Which first requires you know where people are already looking.

[**Google Trends**](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftrends.google.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR16IBHU9Swl2Q6myxqMi7KFSPTHNE79mjbMKo5G7N-PzUIiDH5yLM3eKZ4&h=AT0vJLXp23ytlFuWjhIQqc9muRJirslnENuU_TMrDXA0e9FfR-mHxRzNZseQkFlYpKxGiaYgcwUfyovpQSq1gCUzln9eyK63vSsf2N0qpc15oG5aAkY7SJQZq62D2rSn-gVBxjVaAepaBCwxsLvq7Q) is single-handedly the best place to begin this search.

This is especially true if you’re looking for content creation ideas, say for Social Media. Staying ‘on the pulse’ with trending topics will make your job all that much easier.

I’m not saying go out and spam all the latest gossip on your profiles, especially if you’re running one for a business.

But you SHOULD be aware of the latest gossip / news / updates that are happening in the **social circles** of your **intended audience.**

By studying the rankings and competition of different search terms, you can gain an understanding of multiple angles: the audience and their questions, the competition and their responses, and any gaps / grievances in between that you can fill in with **your** content.

[**SerpStat**](https://serpstat.com/) is a bit more useful if you’re writing for a content-based website and need to see what the **Search Engine Optimization** is like on **Keywords** and **Phrases**.

Pair both of these methods with **Social Media Research** and this process gets even easier.

**Hashtags** are a method that social networks use to categorize the information that is on their servers, this is done so users can parse through specific subjects at will. There are a number of programs which tell you the popularity of these hashtags so you are best prepared to make relevant content.

**Social Blade** is one such network. This tool enables you to view many rankings, statistics, keywords, among other uses.

## Time To Get It All Together

**Capture the Idea** of content as soon as you are able. Whether this means a **short note**, a **voice recording**, a **video reminder**, or even a **sketch**. It doesn’t matter but make sure you **_write it down_**.

Good ideas happen for a reason and you don’t want to miss a single one. A few seconds of getting the gist of an idea out will serve to accelerate the content creation process later.

When it comes to developing content for a specific audience, I like to ask myself two questions:

-   Why should they **‘opt-in’** their attention to what I post?
-   What is my **S.P.I.N.**?

> **SPIN** stands for: **_S_**_olution?_ **_P_**_urpose?_ **_I_**_mpact?_ **_N_**_arrative?_

Is your content based around the solution of a specific problem? Chances are they will want that information.

Is there a specific purpose?

Does it make people laugh?

If you run a profile for Dog Facts, is it about Dog Facts? Each of your posts needs to have a purpose relevant to who’s going to be viewing it.

Is there an emotional impact or reaction? Even IF you have a purpose and want to solve a problem, if you haven’t impacted a person’s emotions, they’re not going to engage.

They won’t purchase your product, they won’t sign up to your email list, they won’t want you to solve the problem (which is the entire purpose, remember?) they won’t be **compelled** to.

Humans are emotional animals, sometimes you need to find their pain point and dig your finger into it... **and _twist_.**

If it’s a problem they care enough about, they will make the next move, which is typically, a **purchase**.

## Humans Love a Good Story

**Finally**, what’s the narrative being told here? If you are selling a product, who’s it for? What’s the story of the perfect person that’s searching for what it is you’re selling?

Don’t tell people what they’ll get with a purchase, or what they’ll get by staying on your page for the best Dog Facts.

Tell them how their life will be changed with a purchase, or give them all the Dog Facts a person can handle.

You’ve heard it time and time again, never sell the **features**, _ALWAYS_ sell the **benefits.**

This goes beyond content that is a lead-in generation for customers.

If you just want to reach more people but aren’t sure how to communicate to them, the value you can provide, start with what will change with them when they begin to interact with you.
