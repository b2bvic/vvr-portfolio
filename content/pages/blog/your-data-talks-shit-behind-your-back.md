tags:: #🤝

Few people know or realize that the applications they use on a daily basis (probably somewhere around the realm of 5 - 8 total) are all sharing information with one another about you.

Your habits, your wants, your needs, your desires.

All of these things are being tracked constantly.

This information is ubiquitous across platforms because that’s the way they were designed.

Nothing on the internet is in a silo.

_(Except the dark web, that’s another email.)_

So what’s this matter to you?

Well, it’s high time you leverage some of this damn data for your own growth.

  

ONE trick to make the algorithms work for me: **_Ads_**

We all know what ads are, we all know how they work.

But did you know that you can curate the ads you receive?

Did you know that you can leverage them to search for the most obscure services, products, or information?

If you didn’t - I suggest you start utilizing the ability to ‘hide’ or ‘block’ ads through the platform themselves, like Facebook.

Reason being is that a great number of service and product based websites are using Google Ads & Facebook Pixel.

I have a very strong suspicion (because it happens to me) that leveraging Facebook’s ads has an inevitable influence on the Google ads you see.

Why?

Because they’re sharing that data.
