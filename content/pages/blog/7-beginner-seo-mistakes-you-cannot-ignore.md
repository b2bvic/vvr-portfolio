7 Beginner SEO Mistakes You Cannot Ignore‍ As a marketer in today’s digital landscape, you are probably executing several marketing strategies that have been proven to have an impact on your brand visibility. As we know, search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the most effective methods for business owners to drive traffic to their website and its content. However, the effectiveness of SEO strategy can be hampered by common mistakes that many self-taught SEOs tend to overlook.

You need to be aware of these mistakes so as not to sabotage your efforts with an unoptimized site. If you don’t implement best practices from the start, you may find it difficult to recover from these blunders later on. Read ahead to learn more about the top 10 SEO mistakes that you cannot ignore. Sitemaps & Indexing Sitemaps are the first line of defense when it comes to technical SEO. A sitemap is an XML file that provides a directory of your website’s content and URLs, letting search engines and other third-party tools know what is available on your site and how they should go about accessing it.

Once your website is indexed, it is bound to receive more organic traffic since it will be easier to crawl and display content on your website. A sitemap can also be used to rectify any issues that may arise with your content, such as broken links or incorrect paths. You should also remember to refresh your sitemap every time you publish new content so that search engines can see it promptly. You should check your Google Search Console often to make sure that your sitemap is working correctly, and that all pages are being indexed by Google.

Meta Titles & Descriptions The next thing that you should work on is optimizing your website’s meta titles and descriptions. These two elements, if optimized correctly, can help your page rise up the search engine results page (SERP) and be seen by a wider audience. The meta title, which appears as a clickable headline on the SERP, should be compelling enough to entice users to click through to your site.

The meta description is a short, summary version of your content that will appear below your title whenever your page is listed on the SERP. Since these two elements have a huge impact on your ranking and click-through rate (CTR), you must nail them. Your meta titles and descriptions should be compelling enough to entice users to click through to your site. Response Codes It is important to keep track of your website’s response codes, which indicate whether the content is being indexed by search engines or not.

Ideally, you should have a “200 - OK” response code in your HTML source code. If you don’t, you may be experiencing a common SEO mistake known as server error (404). A server error is indicative of an unoptimized or broken website. As a result, search engines won’t be able to crawl your content and show it in the SERPs. Therefore, you should make sure that your server is running smoothly and that your site is optimized for performance.

Many tools on the market can help you identify potential issues with your servers, such as broken links and incorrect paths. Dates in Link Structure Another common SEO mistake that many marketers make is using dates in their link structure. While it may seem like a good idea to use dates in your anchor texts, such as “April 2018”, it actually has the opposite effect; it makes your links less relevant and can get you penalized by Google for manipulative link building.

Instead, you should use more generic terms, such as “latest posts”, in your anchor texts to avoid damaging your SEO efforts. Titles & URL not matching The title of your content should be relevant to the URL, but it shouldn’t be a direct match. While this may seem like a minor mistake, it can have a huge impact on your SEO efforts. If your title and URL don’t match, you may experience a drop in organic traffic as Google may not be able to interpret your content correctly.

However, you can easily remedy this by editing your URL until it matches your title. SSL Certificates A significant amount of people use Google to find businesses, products, and services. But, if your website isn’t secure, you run the risk of losing those potential customers. When your website isn’t SSL-certified, it sends a warning signal to search engines that your content isn’t safe to be displayed online.

This can result in a drop in your organic traffic as search engines don’t want to display your content. You can prevent this by getting an SSL certificate. Internal Links Internal links are links from one page on your website to another. They are a great way to inform Google of your website’s hierarchy and structure. They can also boost your CTR and help you rank for long-tail keywords. If you’re not linking pages together, Google may be unable to understand the relationship between your content, which can affect your ranking.

Ideally, you should link every page to at least two other pages. Conclusions SEO is complicated, and there are many mistakes that you can make if you don’t know what you’re doing. That’s why it’s important to find an SEO expert you can trust to help you navigate the complexities of SEO. Choosing the right SEO company can help you avoid these common SEO mistakes and see a significant increase in your organic traffic and conversions.
