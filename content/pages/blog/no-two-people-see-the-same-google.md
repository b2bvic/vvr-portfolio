People who are thinking of Google or getting their website on google are typically enamored by two concepts: keywords & traffic.

The problem with this assumption is it leaves out the entire puzzle of INTENT.

You see, no two people see the same google pages.

There’s too much variance from person to person.

I know I just said in my last release that 10,000 people are just like you & that’s an ‘audience’.

But when you add INTENT as a layer above Keywords, Audiences, & Traffic, you’re starting to see it from a higher dimension.

_If you look at a square, can draw a square over it, and connect the vertices - you are seeing a 3D cube represented on a 2D plane._

_If you look at keyword intent, can draw the traffic over it, and connect the audiences - you are starting to get the picture, yeah?_

**Where does that leave the average person? What can be done about this?**
Well, nothing. It’s too late.

We already use the word “Google” to mean “search the internet for specific information”.

That battle was fought a long time ago.

What comes next though, is what evolves from here. 

Some people think it’s voice search. Some people think it’s video search.

Both of them are right, and that’s why TikTok is soon to become the Number 1 search engine on Earth.

It has an uphill battle against YouTube / Google / Alphabet, but it’s more than possible because it’s quickly becoming an authority of search to the public, especially the YOUTH.

Everyone knows the way you change a culture is by getting to the children.

**That’s what subversion is.**
