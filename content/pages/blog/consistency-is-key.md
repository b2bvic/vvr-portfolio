We hear these words a lot on twitter.

While I do agree, there's something that needs to addressed.¬†

It's negative consistency.

It could be as simple as talking down to yourself after a mistake.

Or the repeated delay of your work due to fear.

Or just wallowing in your own lack of willpower / effort.

I've dealt with this a lot in my own life.

Those who have been receiving emails from me this year, will know this.

Parts of me wanted to do better, try harder, and accomplish more.

Even with my best intentions in mind, there were challenges.

The first of which: Over-Thinking.

What do I mean by this? Simple.

No amount of will is going to change your situation.

Not without discarding the tools that didn't work up until that point.

I don't care if you wake up at dawn, shower with ice, do yoga naked, or run 10 miles.

These activities are great for mindset, but not great for work.

I know this first hand.

It comes down to this, what are 20% of your activities which result in 80% of a return.

Relinquish your old tools to receive better ones.

Simple, right?

Now, if you're like me, and want to stay financially independent. Or want to start working for yourself rather than a 'boss.'

You're going to need some tools.

Lucky for you, there are a great number of them to select.

Unlucky for you, there are a great number of them to select.

You can spend the next few years testing and experimenting.

But why do that when I‚Äôve done the hard work for you?

[Victor‚Äôs Quick 62 Freelance Toolkit](http://bit.ly/VictorsQuick62) is being written with you in mind.¬†

From the perspective of a beginner, but i‚Äôm not going to lie to you, I don‚Äôt hold back.

In fact, there are more than a few programs that are included on that list which you probably don‚Äôt need to know about.

But I included them anyway.

If you‚Äôd like to find out what this fuss is over, pre-order the ebook now.

On Monday, December 17th, the price increases to $17, where it will stay forever.

Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn ya.

You are strong.

You are loved.

You are free.

Thank you for reading.

Your friend,

Victor V.
