_When we attempt a new skill, there is a habit for people to get too ‘caught up’ in overthinking an action. Let’s cover the system I use when attempting anything for the first time._

You want to learn something new.

Perhaps it’s a language, a technology, a creative outlet, a physical skill, whatever.

What’s the usual line of thinking that occurs when you undertake an action for the first time?

Over-thinking? Over-analysis? Self-doubt?

Also known as paralysis by analysis.

Now, I’ve attempted more than my fair share of skills:

-   Public Speaking
-   Music Performance
-   Writing
-   Media Production
-   Photography
-   Systems-Building
-   Training / Live Instruction

Everything you do has to be attempted once.

Let’s get better at that first attempt.

Don't Presume Your Failure

Although it seems obvious, it’s really setting the tone for the next two steps.

Most people don’t believe in themselves when they attempt something for the first time.

This behavior can be learned from a myriad of sources, but the point of it is: you should never be your worst enemy.

If that voice in your head is feeding you doubt, take a breath and follow the next step.

Visualize Yourself Doing The Thing

This was a lesson my father imbued in me when I was a very small child.

He taught me that in order to throw a paper ball into the trash can, I should first see myself making it in my head.

Through the power of visualization, you are better suited for actually doing what you intend to do.

So step 1, see yourself doing the thing.

Give 3 Genuine Attempts Before Reassessing

Try the thing 3 times.

You need to be able to determine a pattern with your attempts.

A single attempt doesn’t give you enough data to know what needs to be improved.

Three times, however, does give you enough information to figure out exactly what’s going on.

Most people don’t even work themselves up for the 1st attempt, so they following 2 are completely unheard of.

Think about these things when you go to teach yourself that next skill.
