_Looking back on your past can be difficult at times. Moments of pain, joy, embarrassment, grief, and love, all of it culminating into the person you are._

All of your experiences, your interactions with others, sculpt you into the person you come to know & love (or hate), but I want to provide a number of tools I use to re-contextualize my past.

Some refer to this process of alchemy. Turning lead to gold.

Considerations of Your Memory

If you’re familiar with any amount of my writing, you’ll know that I view my internal world with at least two voices.

These are the two ‘voices’ I believe every person has:

1.  **Play-by-Play:** This is your observation of reality and the reactions you have from them.
2.  **Color Commentator:** The reaction **_to your reaction._**
Did I lose you? Here’s an example:

**Scenario: You’ve been cut off on the freeway.**
_Play-by-Play: “Hey this car is cutting you off” *reacts*_

_CC: “This dickhead almost fucking killed me!” *reacts to your reaction*_

When you begin to understand that much of your memories are marinated in the story you’ve told yourself over and over again, you can remove a bit of the emotional sting from the recollection.

The way I approach keywords is the same way I approach emotions or memories

Procedurally, within context of understanding

[11:55 AM - 6 Jan 2022](https://twitter.com/SubtleBodhi/status/1479134465767186439)

_(Semi-related tweet: I’ll get into how I marry this with SEO in another email)_

That’s step 1. Here’s step 2.

Reflection on your past should happen **_from_** the impression that you earned through the experience itself.

As stated in my tweet above, “Procedurally, within the context of understanding.”

So, the ‘you’ now, looking back on the ‘you’ then.

Visualize that version of yourself.

That ‘you’ now is the mentor of the ‘you’ that needed it _then._

**Time and space are not a factor in your mind.**
You will heal parts of your past through simple reflection with the understanding of the present.

I’ll leave you with a one more related tweet.

Two lessons I've distilled from psychedelics:

1. Self-driven narratives can be changed at any time, they are subject to circumstance & experience

2. Forgive yourself for what you had to do to survive the past (See no. 1)

Drop me a line if this is something you need more clarity on.

Thank you for reading.
