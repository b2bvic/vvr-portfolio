Last night, I wrote about an adventure in the woods.

  

Today, I’d like to describe a little more of my mindset since this experience.

  

Over the last 8 years, I have dealt with a looming reality:

  

I don’t really ‘know’ myself because i’ve spent so much time learning / trying to fix others.

  

I’ve been attempting to exert control over people and minds that are not my own.

  

It wasn’t up until a few months ago that I determined no amount of my effort will help build a person who doesn’t want to help themselves.

  

But after that shroom trip, on the day when the star Sirius is in alignment with our own Sol, I learned a disturbing reality about my nature.

  

I don’t have one.

  

The memories that I used to associate by, the pain that determined my actions, even the experiences that I’ve had recently (like fighting my bloodied father in a mechanic’s parking lot) are no longer variables in the way I feel.

  

One could say, I have healed.

I have healed from my trauma.

  

I have learned from my mistakes.

  

I have forgiven myself for the abuse I exerted onto others, while admitting my responsibility of those action, to them.

  

This amount of self-honesty is radical in its application and function. 

  

It’s hard to admit when you’re a piece of shit.

  

Straight up.

  

But it’s necessary to know that it was (often) the only route that seemed available to one during duress.

  

As my good friend, @MindTendencies has said on twitter:

You did what was required to receive the level of clarity you know hold in the present.

  

It’s okay to forgive. You’re safe now. You’re grown.

  

Once you heal your inner-child, you can stop associating by their pain.

You can let that child “go play.”

  

The more often you fall into this state of appreciation and wonder, the less often you’ll find this world as despicable.

  

You’ll start to play, too.

  

Avoid nihilism. It won’t serve you.

  

Sure, things don’t make sense.

  

But would it be fun if the puzzle was easy?

  

As a child, I absolutely loved (and still do tbh) untangling cords.

  

Whether they be video cables, power cords, headphones, anything.

  

I just have a knack for absorbing the details while keeping the larger picture in mind.

  

Mind you, I was about 4 or 5 when I started doing that.

  

The child that was once me, is curiously brilliant.

  

The adult that is me, is a lazy dick.

  

So, combining both, should lead me somewhere along the zero point for Wu Wei.

“Wu Wei (chinese, literally “non-doing”) is an important concept of Taoism and means natural action, or in other words, action that does not involve struggle or excessive effort.

Wu wei is the cultivation of a mental state in which our actions are quite effortlessly in alignment with the flow of life.

This going with the flow, although it may be greatly productive, is characterized by great ease where we spontaneously act perfectly.

This means that we do the right thing effortlessly and spontaneously, without trying.”

Imagine, the motivation, curiosity, and unadulterated (pun intended af) FUN that a child has…

  

With the discernment to know boundaries, stay aware, and keep a neutral demeanor.

  

I’ve always had an affinity for eastern philosophy.

  

Life is fun.

Creation is fun.

  

We often forget the original purpose of why we came to this realm.

  

And for most of us, it was to endure a life unlike your predecessors, in order to reach a level of clarity they don’t.

  

To heal yourself of your trauma, heal your parents of theirs, heal your family.

  

Then hold the space of neutrality for others, for that is their waking dream.

  

Nothing affects you with permission.

  

Don’t be ‘love and light’.

  

Don’t be ‘evil or dark’.

  

Be both, all, neither.

  

Just…

  

Be.
