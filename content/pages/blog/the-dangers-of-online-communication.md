When people warn you about networking on the internet, I feel as though it is approached with an archaic mindset.

Being 26, I remember growing up in a world where we avoided strangers, explored our hometowns until the sun went down / the ‘lights’ came on, & generally had an experience that was not unlike the generations that have come before us.

Our mindset to strangers was simple: **don't** talk to them, **don't** get into their vehicles, and **don't** allow them to take you anywhere you shouldn't be.

I'm not going to say that these considerations are to be ignored in the modern age, in fact, I feel they are more strongly relevant than they've ever been. But there comes a point in our lives where we feel it necessary to branch out, and explore extended networks for those of us that 'resonate' with one another.

More often than not, we find ourselves evermore lonely in our ever-connected world.

With social media, the remedy has never been easier. Personally, there are around 4,000 people (on twitter) who resonate with whatever my thoughts happen to be on a given day. I didn't ask them to follow me, I didn't engage anything other than my observations.

﻿However, this isn't enough if you plan to make a lasting change in this world. You **need** to do **more**. You need to bring it into the physical; create lasting impressions and _build something tangible_.

As you may or may not know, I recently moved from my hometown of Riverside, Southern California, to Raleigh, North Carolina. I've been on the East Coast for about two months.

I can tell you, I have changed as a person in that short amount of time.

This is the ﻿real ﻿danger of online communities, when you go way out of your comfort zone, and challenge yourself to stretch beyond your current limits into a new environment, you'd be surprised at what you're capable of, especially when in a group of like-minded individuals.

﻿Tribes are exactly the way that Humans learned to navigate this world and nothing has changed that. Modernity has just lulled us into **_sleeping at the wheel_**. Believing that we act better as **individuals** rather than **communities**.

This is simply false.﻿﻿﻿﻿

Exploration is a concept that is scary to many, especially if you've never left your home, which is my exact experience. 25 years spent within a 150 mile radius. I know Southern California like the back of my hand.

﻿And that is the exact reason why I needed to leave.

﻿You see, the danger of online communication is not who you'll meet, but how you'll ﻿change. A fair amount of people only dream of leaving their hometowns in order to seek out a better life for themselves.﻿﻿

﻿It is my belief that our personalities are nothing more than the impression left unto us by others and the impressions that we leave onto others by us.

﻿People remember you based on your actions, if you habitually repeat those actions, you will have a reputation, they will craft a narrative, you'll begin to believe that narrative rather than acting in an organic way.

The point is: **_challenge yourself to experience your world in a different way, even if this means completely abandoning the environments (internal or external) that you consider most important (or defining) to your experience._**﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿‍

Got it? Good.
