It's sort of dawned on me recently that I have a wide set of skills that underlie a few industries.

  

Namely: Media, Marketing, & Production

  

What surprised me, though, is reaching back into my childhood to see just exactly dries me to be in these fields.

  

I remember being much more introverted as a child, especially because I was a little show-off know-it-all.

  

So I'd often speak up to give answers, my own opinions, or insights. Fast forward through Elementary (where i tutored 3rd graders in reading ‚Äî at age 5), and we get to Middle School.

  

By this point, I had all but checked out in trying to show off, I was now using the natural inquisitiveness to coast me through school, waiting until the last possible second to complete work assigned, sleeping during tests, and actively pissing off teachers / other students.

  

Except in one activity in particular‚Ä¶

  

It was called KWIN, it was our school's morning broadcasts. I joined in 7th grade as an announcer, as one of the few who could read in a natural speaking tone.

  

As I recall, there was an ancient video switcher used, and we had little camcorders for the student announcers and the guest Pledgers for the flag.

  

Even earlier than that, there were all of the times that I was recorded as a child. My dad‚Äôs dad was a photographer, so naturally, he bought a camcorder to document our ‚Äúadventures‚Äù which were nothing more than walks to the park or exploration of the local neighborhoods.

  

A lifetime of getting used to having a lens act as nothing more than the perspective of the person who couldn‚Äôt attend but will later take part in a passive way. Through the lens of the capturer, engrossed within his story‚Äôs telling of that event.

  

It‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve gotten used to on another level because I‚Äôve been performing in front of groups since a young age, at first for displays of skills, computation, or memory. If my dad hadn‚Äôt of been a break dancer only a few years before having me, he‚Äôd likely neer would have had ambitions to be a DJ. Which in turn would have prevented me from becoming a beatboxer.

  

So as far as I can recall, I‚Äôve taken part in the methods required to tell a story.

  

Years after learning to beatbox, I began learning trombone in High School, due to being approached by the music teacher after performing a set at the high school for an event. I was essentially tricked into thinking that a human beatboxer would somehow make sense with a marching band. I was naive and ambitious, to say the least.

  

But it got me learned on trombone within 6 months, quickly becoming the section leader and helping new students learn the instrument. The techniques used to play a trombone are nearly identical to those used for some beatboxing kick drums and bass lines. Between that, and having already built up diaphragm control, I was in the pocket in terms of learning music.

  

Soon after, my interest in music folded upon itself once again in the form of playing piano. Being the impatient person that I am, I learned how to play the piano before i learned how to ready treble clef. Which means that I wasn‚Äôt technically a piano player until this happened much later in college, but for the time being, I had taught myself a working ability to play the piano. But more importantly, I learned that there are methods besides the standard model for learning music, and this would become pivotal later in life.

  

Within 2 years of learning how to play music, I began another layer to my performance history through the means of a ska / punk / reggae band. Performances were common all along southern california, including some venues that others considered ‚Äòimpressive‚Äô.

  

By age 21, I‚Äôd already played for 3 bands, been included in studio recordings, performed with my college‚Äôs ensembles, and was quickly on my way to a 4 year university for music performance.

  

Life had other plans for me.

  

I continued writing heavily, focusing in on marketing efforts after considering my knowledge in music sufficient for what I‚Äôd like to accomplish in life. At this point, I began to notice that certain skills were applicable in learning completely different industries.¬†

  

Still stuck in the cycle of warehouses, production plants, and other temporary jobs, I continued working on obtaining any position that I could see increase my potential down the line.

  

Luckily for me, during this point in time, my love interest was an Anthropology Undergrad who not only needed assistance in summarizing her reading, but also with grading papers, and even editing her own work.

  

The information was incredibly dense, but it was building my skills in a few critical areas that will come into play later. It would become crucial as information research would later become a major part of my work.¬†

  

Because I was able to do this through most of her studies, she agreed to allow a resume reference, showing that even though I am not a college graduate myself, I am more than capable of handling the work that is assigned, I can always verbally explain what I don‚Äôt like about the structure.¬†

  

It wasn‚Äôt too long after this that I was able to make contact with a local non-profit in the city that I grew up in. The way I met him was totally by chance, as I was busy smoking weed with my dad, appearing like a¬† total delinquent when approached about needing some help. Meeting this person enabled a demonstration of my skills in a way that would become paramount to my hiring as a marketing coordinator in my next job.¬†

  

So far i‚Äôve covered: Live Communication, Performance, Instruction, Marketing, Writing, Research, Editing, Music, and I was only 23.

  

But I was finally hired by a real company to handle their marketing for them on a daily basis, being able to track my impact from the beginning, documenting my change to the company‚Äôs structure and bottom line.

  

It really took all of the skills I had learned up until this point to take on this opportunity, because I lay my way into the position by claiming more knowledge than I had, but nothing that I couldn‚Äôt teach myself within a few focused hours.¬†

  

There was no marketing in place, I taught myself a lot within a few months:

  

Email marketing, Visual Design, Copywriting, Advertisements, Management, eCommerce, Photography for Products, Website Design, and even a little bit of video recording.¬†

  

It was at this point that I started to see content for what it was online, nothing more than the sharing of your experienced in ways that are digestible and nuanced. People love anecdotes, parables, and ciphers.¬†

  

I enjoyed two years within a gray building before I was ready to leave, having become completely familiar with dropshipping, whitelabelling, manufacturing, producing, pricing, supply & demand, and ways NOT to run a successful staff.

  

That brings us up through the last year, where I‚Äôve grown accustomed to the flexibility of a free schedule, although there have been aspects of it which I have yet to master. The worst of which are consistent, daily action, and ensuring that my schedule is filled with the most profitable activities imaginable.

  

Due to my ability to create social media / website content, I was brought on to supervise the marketing of a local megachurch. In Directing / Producing their livestream content, I have increased their online reach in a way they were not capable of doing alone. It took them 7 years to build an audience of 4,000. It took me 9 months to nearly quadruple that figure.

  

Along with being able to practice / sharpen my existing skills, I was able to become more familiar with working alongside high-level directors and executives. To such an extent, that they are now available as work contacts, further fleshing out my contact / network list, and increasing the possibilities of creating some large projects if they were to arrive.

  

One of the final pieces to this entire thing comes in the form of stagecraft. Having already performed as a musician, and produced the church‚Äôs program, it was the last perspective I needed to get a full grasp on the entire concept of a production. One that could encompass the digital marketing, real-world coverage, and physical assemblage.

  

But, this whole long-winded explanation has been geared to creating your own mastery, but what parts of this writing imply that any mastery is taking place?

  

Individually, it may appear that I have acquired a list of skills that looks like should be a part of a temp agency‚Äôs questionnaire for employment. But there is a crucial consideration to be had: it‚Äôs in the organization of most of these skills that, when arranged properly, can compound onto themselves to create a vortex of opportunity.¬†

  

This is the organization that I eventually see as 3005 Media. A company that moves beyond the arbitrary limitations of digital media, into real-world coverage and the ability to bridge all gaps for a client.¬†

  

The logic of this approach is a reverse-engineering of something like mycelium. These organisms are older than most fungus and all flora / fauna. This organism to the go-between for so many different variables that it eventually building an ecosystem around itself, balancing all of the variables necessary to ensure its own survival, along with the survival of all other parties that also have come to rely on.¬†

  

My natural talent took me far in learning about what I'm particularly interested in - as far as content creation, production, and that sort of involvement. It was my discipline of traversing so many different work environments that eventually led me to create full-on functional systems that I know are still in motion today, long after my involvement has ceased.

  

In following my own interests and passions, I've become the weaver between far-reaching sections of creativity. ANd I know I'm not the only person to have accomplished this feat of mastery at such a young age.

  

This is where the rest of 3005 begins to come in.

  

The first is Edward, the original proprietor of 3005 Media, his brainchild. Is a person of business acumen and creative expression. With a BS in Business, he has the instruction and experience of working within a successful business, and remaining a pivotal part of one‚Äôs operation. COmbine this with a natural hustler‚Äôs mindset and the ability to manage data, and he‚Äôs an organizational powerhouse. Bringing with him a background of Direct Sales, Marketing, Management, Data, Finances, Arbitrage, viewed through a Creative‚Äôs lens.

  

Next is Vanessa, or as she‚Äôs known in her circles, Princess. We have here yet another creative with a background that is not much different to my own, a person who followed the interests she had as a child, and it‚Äôs led her to an entrepreneurial life of artistry. Painting, Music, Raising / Selling Plants, Photography, Editing, & Writing, with a knack of having natural ability in most of her explorations. She is a socialite with the skills and vision of an Artisan.

  

Finally, we have Eli, being the youngest of any of us, just finishing up his teenage years, this youth is a media master in his own right, boasting a decade‚Äôs experience in media production. He spends most of his time covering local community events, including photos, video, editing, and directing. He commands a natural drive and nonchalant method of creating the perfect representation for any of his assignments.

  

As you can see, it‚Äôs become increasingly apparent to me, that one creative is not going to be enough to handle the amount of variables that come across with any endeavor. It‚Äôs been my personal mission to start seeking out individuals with boast a number of skills, a natural ability to instruct themselves, and a background of overcoming their own adversity towards their success.

  

This is exactly what separates 3005 Media from the competition.¬†

  

We‚Äôre young.

  

We‚Äôre hungry.

  

We‚Äôre creative as hell.

  

And we‚Äôre ready to work with you.
