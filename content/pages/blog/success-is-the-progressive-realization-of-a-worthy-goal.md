Once You’ve Got Step One; Step Too 

Keep the above process in mind and I’ll walk you through the changes in position, industry, and responsibility.

1.  Content Writer
2.  Marketing Coordinator
3.  Marketing Supervisor
4.  Director of Livestream Production for Megachurch
5.  Executive Assistant for a Real Estate Firm
6.  Owner / Operator of Marketing Agency
7.  Board Member of Media for a Nonprofit
8.  SEO for Web3 Startup
9.  SEO Manager of B2B Marketing Agency

I want you to ignore everything I just listed except Numbers 1 and 8, because this correlation is the most fascinating.

10 years experience on that list between 1 and 8

It took me about 5 years of SEO study and another 5 years of tangental-exploration before I decided that, “Yeah, I actually like this Search Engine stuff.”

But I didn’t choose SEO.

I was already a writer.

A lifetime love of reading & writing had put me into advanced placement & international baccalaureate in high school, and the honors program for my brief college career.

When you learn how to effectively communicate in these formats, there are few others that are out of reach.

Search Engine Optimization is something special though, it’s a puzzle that changes every time you go to look for it.

Your solutions within the industry are only guaranteed until they are not. If you’re not actively researching and studying - you’re toast.

Here’s why I think SEO is special as a discipline:

-   It’s a lens, informing everything from writing to media production.
-   It’s a discipline I lean on each day, as I tend to live & die by my ability to track down specific information on the internet, both for personal and professional use.
-   It’s an ever-evolving industry, it is completely different from what it was 10 years ago. 
-   It helps me continually sharpen the ‘this-is-complicated-make-it-simple’ muscle by way of 

I can go on but I think you get the point. 

This sort of career-exploration is unique to circumstance, opportunity, and preparation. 

No two people are going to walk the same path. 

But that’s sort of the reason why you’re here in the first place, no?

Success is the Progressive Realization of a Worthy Goal

Reflecting on these ideas may take some time. I know it’s taken me a lot longer to ‘chew’ on this than I wanted to.

All of this writing is a collection of conversations that I’ve had over the last two and a half years while figuring out what I’m made of.

It’s my goal to lend a bit of clarity, it doesn’t matter what your profession is. 

You’re moving through your career path and it begins with the job you’re working now, or have worked in the past, or will work in the future. 

Formal education is irrelevant if you’re willing to live each day as a student.

Find what you love, find what you do well, find what will support your lifestyle.

Once you’ve got these ideas down, set some goals and break it down by the day. Put in the reps.

You have no idea where you’ll take you.

Thank you for reading.
