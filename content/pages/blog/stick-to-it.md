Whaddup motherfuckers,

I just got back from a long day of moving furniture, following by a lengthy conversation at the bar with my mentor / roommate / business partner who is quickly becoming the most influential mentor in my life.

We discussed the makings of what creates a person that is worth wealth, and I had some bombshells dropped on me.

First of all, did you know it’s not often that people can recognize and recollect the lessons in their life?

Because I sure as fuck didn’t. 

I have a problem with assuming that people are as smart as I am and that’s either an underestimation of myself or an over-estimation of others….

EITHER WAY…

I got told some game about the person i am and the opportunity i have laid out in front of me.

Better than that, i’ve been working toward these ends since i was 17, when i had a telemarketing job for selling Verizon FiOS

Problem with that job was, I was always able to get people to the closing stage, but none of them had the credit in order to get through that final stage of purchase. Although I didn’t understand the deeper nuances to working a sales job when I was clearly not cut out for it and only cared about the hourly wage.

Regardless, the last several years have led up to the opportunities i’m facing now.

Dealing with multiple business ventures, getting into stocks, and figuring out just how much this brain of mine can cash in for those i love the most.

Straight up, you’re one of the lucky ones.

You knew me before I blew up (probably).

Fact of the matter is, I’m on my way to creating more opportunities for myself than most people DENY in their lives.

I have it.

Fuck you if you disagree.

Me and mine are gonna eat and you’ll see.

I’m more surprised at the fact that i’ve manifested a mentor that can not only benefit my life, but i’m simplifying his in the same fucking route.

Until you’ve mastered as many field as i’ve failed, you’ll probably get the picture.

But it’s not up to me to convince you.

You’ll see it soon enough.

Because this man is teaching me how to become a machine physically and mentally, the only way I can repay that teaching is making his life, and subsequently, money, easier.

To the effect that i’m learning how to play the stock market, and considering a fucking real estate license.

This is the effect of staying true to your cause over the course of YEARS.

You start to see the biggest effects possible rather than being stuck with “figuring it out.”

The biggest transfer of wealth is going on now.

I invested in silver years ago, and own more than you’ve ever seen in person.

Now it’s time for me to learn how to manage proper risk.

And due to this effect, you’ll learn it yourself.

Because i’m not a piece of shit.

You’re welcome.

You’re friend always,

Victor the fucking Valentine Romo

Remember the name.

Until next time.
