What if you could see the structure of your thoughts built by your internet habits?

Would you believe that it's the relationship of your favorite activities online to build and built by specific thought patterns and behaviors?

Are you certain that people on mass are not all being monitored, tracked, and guided by the sights & powers unseen?

Algorithms which have had real world effects around us, from revolution to stolen elections (which are often the same thing but we'll save that for another video).

The patterns of your day are being broken down by your internet activity on multiple levels, from the internet service provider, the maker of your smartphone, the web browser, and the search engine.

When these patterns are charted, who is the one that benefits? At first glance we assume it's us. Because we want to see what we want to see, right? Wrong.

There is a way to combat this tracking. It's to track yourself. Learn your own patterns, mantras, and behaviors. Becoming an informed individual has little to do with "common sense" and everything to do with self-knowing.

This device you are staring at was not created to do this - but became that through, at best - hubris. And at worst - malice.

Let's learn together, how you can "log in" to your own mind. Best part about it is - you don't have to give me (or anyone else) any information to do so.

The sharpening of your own awareness is what creates the ability to discern how much of your thoughts are really yours.

In a world where you are being bombarded with advertisements copy and creatives, it is imperative.

But what creates your ability to make this discernment?

What gives you the skill the be able to look at yourself and make that decision?

It comes down to two factors:

1. A relentless desire to track your own activity not only on the internet, but in your life as well.
2. The discipline to know when to pull your phone out to type a good idea or keep track of something that you searched on the internet.

One you decide you can do both of these things, you can then begin to build up the mindset of how to keep such a log for yourself.

There are many tools that you can attempt to use for a purpose like this:
- Notes App
- Google Keep
- Google Docs
- Evernote
- Notion
- Roam Research
- MS Notepad
- An Excel Spreadsheet
- A Blog

But I'm finding there's one program in particular that is up to the task of off-loading the amount of cognitive stress in a living index. Alive index. A Live Index.

That program is Obsidian Markdown.

Here's why, and there are several compelling reasons:
1. Locally Stored Database
2. Exists as a file structure on your computer
3. Accepts file structures on your computer
4. Does not use the cloud (unless you want to sync it between devices)
5. Utilizes backlinks (a skill for SEO and a visual graph builder)

This is the most current version of my second brain.

Mind you, I am using it to track my personal thoughts, researched internet queries, ideas, writing, standard operating procedures, all of my primary sources, the salaried position, the day-rate position, and OC definitions of each subject that ties them all together.

I also have every single contact that I have kept in touch with over the last 10 years.

If we're talking and some good ideas or memories were had, i'm putting them in Obsidian.

The reason I've been so heads down is because I've been spending my time on this program. Making these connections.

Studying the physical connection of my ideas is bringing a level of clarity an exponential application of effort I've ever experienced in my life.

Here's the reason why:

I can stop worrying about the things that I have to carry in my head anymore.

It's an index that grows with you, because you add to it as your learn, write, discover, and grow.

This is the one program where everything else just makes sense about it. At least from an SEO's perspective.

Backlinks are a major one. Backlinks not only teach you about how the internet has built its relevance over the last 30 years, it also shows you how your ideas are interlinked with one another.

When you study the structure of your ideas and your thoughts, you're working on them from the dimension above your current understanding.

This is the higher-level application of reviewing what you know, checking the reasoning behind it, at the time of its's discovery, through the time of your growth.

2D is learning the subjects & information.

3D is applying the information & forming frameworks.

4D is visualizing the form & shape of your informed frameworks.

This is all very heady stuff, it doesn't really make any sense just to read about how I have worked at it.

The time for you to begin creating the only weapon that has a chance at standing against the war for your attention and allegiance.

There are so many narratives going on right now about the world around you and the entire point is to keep you distracted from the world between your eyes.

A small voice lives inside you that wonders why and wants to grwo, learn information, but also recall that information at a moment's notice.

Obsidian has been the medium I can peer into myself with.

The name of it is almost too fitting, as the why I'm using it, it has become not only the medium I scribe to, but scry too.

A decision has to be made for yourself that you're not going to wait around for the next trend.

You have plenty to work with. It's all already in your head.

If you're anything like me, you don't need the extra database stuff that Notion offers.

A clunky interface is worse than a clunky mind.

Instead, this is an option to rant and be sporadic, move in an order that makes sense to no one except you, build the connections that make you unique and see them in a way you never have before.

These things are right at your fingertips.

They are here. Ready for your use.

Nature happens not with wants. Nature happens with will.
