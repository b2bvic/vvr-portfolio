The act of coming up with an internet brain is not some open secret. 

But it does take understanding some basics about the internet that I feel most people intuit but don't explicitly understand.

One of those basics is "data in, data out".

You're already doing this from day to day. The information that you willingly put into websites gets passed along to other sources, this is "data in".

The information (or content) that you take in on a daily basis can also be thought of as "data out".

What I'm going to teach you in this email is how to leverage these two ideas.

Normally, when you use apps you're going to find you can only send or receive data, but you will not have an ability to interact with the medium handling the data.

When referring to this sort of medium, I'm talking about a platform that allows you to 'switch' where data is incoming or outgoing from.

Remember the way telephones used to be run? With manual operators that switch the cables to 'connect' your call?

That same process still happens over the internet, just automatically and without your involvement. 

So, you want to have more of a hand in how your data is used from day to day in life. Makes sense. But next is how?

The main question becomes, what is your goal for the data?

Some people are going to want to know more about themselves and their habits. 

Typical ideas that come to mind are for: **fitness, diets, travel, expenses.**
This sort of data is great for getting an overall or birds-eye view of your life. 

If you run your own business, there may be other considerations that are more important to you:

1.  Managing inventory, employees, payroll, other admin duties
2.  Maintaining a website or google my business profile
3.  Social media content, outreach, and customer support

Here's the big question to ask yourself: which platform suits my needs best?

For a lot of people, a good system is nothing more than using their Notes app religiously.
