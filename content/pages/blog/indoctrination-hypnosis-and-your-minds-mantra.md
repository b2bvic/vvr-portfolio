## Self-Induced Hypnosis.

  

Have you ever had an idea that swelled your being with possibility, with wonder?

  

A thought pops into your head like, “I’ll never be able to do that.”

  

“I don’t have that sort of talent.”

  

“That’s just not a possibility.”

  

This, my friends, is another form of crippling thought that puts limits on the creative fire within us that wants to burn the world (in love).

  

It stems from the same words that those external sources implanted within us over and over and over again.

  

Over a great amount of time.

  

I’ve dealt with it in my own life.

  

Although a level of surety in my attempts, a little voice in my head exudes doubts whenever a new idea comes.

  

This was particularly true when I started to get into marketing for myself.

  

Before I ever worked as a desk-jockey, I was just a content writer for my roommate, who was a web designer.

  

Just getting the hang of internet marketing, he would often fill my head with lots of ideas for making money, starting my own websites, and generally trying to make a name for myself within this digital space.

  

Tony, you’ll probably never read this, but i appreciate you immensely.

  

However, I was only 19 when I started copywriting for him.

  

The internal voice of self-doubt and limitation was much louder.

  

Same call it ‘Ego’, I call it, the ‘Fuck You’ voice.

  

He’s much quieter now, but during my youth, and especially during my psychedelic trips, he makes his presence known.

  

And while I was 19, his presence was so well-known i often mistook it for the voice that leads me into new territory, new adventures, new experiments.

  

The trick is to become aware of when one voice is speaking toward your growth.

  

And when another is speaking toward your limitation.

  

We all build our own mental prisons, this is something you cannot refute, and if you attempt to, the mirror within me will reflect that back at you.

  

This is one of the reasons I say that interaction with me changes people.

  

Because I've torn much of my mental limitation down.

  

I always pursue the next fear, always.

  

Reason being is, if we’re not afraid of the next possibility, have we grown to the point of releasing the ones we currently entertain?

  

My guess would be no.

  

The internal tool for this mental prison, put simply: is Shame.

  

Shame is a crippling method of breaking a person down.

  

Our parents use it.

  

Our religious institutions use it.

  

Our governments use it.

  

Why?

  

Because it works.

  

How dare you go against my word? After all I done for you, the clothes on your back, the food in your mouth, all this i’ve done for you.

  

This was something my parents would utilize on me until i got to the age of 7.

  

My response was succinct and cut them down to the core.

  

I didn’t ask to be here. You do this because I’m your mistake.

  

Insensitive? Yes. Wrong? No.

  

God sacrificed his only Son to heal you of your sins, and this is how you repay him?

  

If Jesus truly believed in his actions, would he not understand my reasoning for doubt? Would you dare question God’s perfect creation of my thought process?

  

This was my response to church at around 12. Soon enough I found myself becoming an ‘agnostic’ and turning to Science to explain the world around me.

  

Foolish? Yes. Wrong? Not at the time. It was necessary.

  

The government is here to protect us, to make sure that riots don’t happen on the streets. We have freedom in this country, do you not understand?

  

A true definition of ‘rights’ and ‘freedom’ are self-evident, and shouldn’t require an authority figure in order for these concepts to hold weight.

  

This was me at around 18, when I became an Anarchist. 

  

Fact of the matter is, shame should not be co-opted by the entities who try to impose it onto you.

  

Whether it be your parents, family, religion, or government.

  

Do not allow your mind to be soft.

  

Do not repeat their mantras.

  

I stopped speaking the Pledge of Allegiance at 12.

  

I still stood for the flag (which is bad enough) but I refused to utter those words that I learned when I was 5 years old.

  

The reason being, is that no child understands what those words mean.

  

Yet, many people still refer to simple concepts like the Star Spangled Banner or the colors of our flag and tie that into what it means to be ‘free’.

  

My friends, freedom means to have a choice of choosing the opposite of the status quo.

  

This goes no different for the governing parts of your mind.

  

There is a voice that analyzes the world around you due to the electrical synapses received from your senses.

  

There is another voice that creates a story around these reactions, we often call them ‘memories’.

  

Then, there is one final voice which whispers softly. 

  

One of inspiration.

  

One of hope.

  

One of possibilities.

  

This is the voice that needs the spotlight.

  

Reality, no matter how it’s explained does not exist.

  

99.9999999% of atoms are empty space.

  

We see < 1% of the Electromagnetic spectrum in the form of ‘Visible Light’.

  

Our recollection of memory is malleable. 

  

Our brains run at a 500ms lag behind what’s happening.

  

Every time your eyes move to the following word on this screen, it’s cutting away the ‘blur’ that would happen from the sweep.

  

Our brains try and convince us that THIS is the way to live.

  

That THIS is the way we must think.

  

That we are bound by that which does not serve us.

  

Our habits.

  

Our concepts and mis-conception.

  

Our patterns.

  

Our subscription to those mental stories we associate with our possibilities, limitations, and capabilities.

  

We are not our minds.

  

We are not our limits.

  

We are creation, embodied.

  

Take a breath and appreciate the triple-entendre of that last sentence.

  

This reality stems from our mind but also is the effect of it.

  

Become comfortable with the paradox.

  

Because once you have,

  

You’ll see that this place is not so absolute.

  

Everything is malleable.

  

All is opportunity, in the creator’s mind.

  

The next time you have a limiting thought pattern or voice of doubt.

  

Breathe into it. Send love to it. That voice just wants some attention; wants action on its behalf.

  

I used to believe I was borderline schizophrenic.

  

But I know that it’s the product of a mind trapped within the open-air hamster cage that we call Civil-Lie-Say-Shun. (Civilization)

  

I get along with my demons. I exercise / exorcise them.

  

Those voices are not me.

  

But are remnants of a program i’m still defragmenting.

  

I hope this serves you well.
