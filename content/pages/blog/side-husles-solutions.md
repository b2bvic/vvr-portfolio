I once had a conversation with my sister.

She’s 16 months my younger, and even though is currently staying with family, she’s come under a sudden realization:

Her hourly wage employment is barely keeping her above water.

I could tell she was a little stressed, though she tried to play it off.

Being her older brother, I do what most (good) older siblings do:

I provided solutions.

I started with “everyone needs a side-hustle” and began naming any ideas that could resonate with her.

She drives a newer car, so I suggested Uber / Lyft + any other delivery service.

She used to dog-sit, I suggested creating a website to walk dogs (since she has the mornings to herself).

She cleans really thoroughly, I told her to start a mobile cleaning-service (again, paired with a website).

A sad fact of life in this world is that the ‘traditional’ way of ~doing things~ is going to bring stagnation, drain motivation, and eventually sap all inspiration. Not to mention keep you poor

But it only becomes a detriment when it’s allowed, like anything within this reality, it takes the perspective of believing the illusion, in order for it to infect.

All is opportunity in the Creator’s mind.

This is a quote that I live each day by.

Paired with the first Hermetic Law of Tehuti it’s power is amplified further.

The Principle of Mentalism: The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental.

One can see where our power truly lies.

Perspective is key, solution-oriented thought patterns are (by definition) better than “problem-solving.”

Problem-solving implies that’s all you’ll ever be able to achieve, solving one problem in replacement for the next. Continually working to match the colors on a Rubix cube just to have your 3x3 become a 4x4.

Repeat ad nauseum to infinity.

You won’t solve every problem you encounter.

But you will create solutions that can not only satisfy the requirements of a problem, but prepare you for a mindset that takes any problem in stride.

Abundance is all around us.

It’s a simple fact of life.

It’s the reason you’re breathing.

It’s the reason I’m typing this.

If you can’t understand the consequences of a victim-mindset;

You’ll never begin to comprehend the sol-u-tion (soul you shun).
