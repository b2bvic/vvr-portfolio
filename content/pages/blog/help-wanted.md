"I love seeing 'Help Wanted' signs because it asking for assistance happens even on an independent venture."

  

Or something like that. To that effect, at least.

  

I hit up a friend who lives a city over from where I set up a Graduation stage of a satellite campus to the college I dropped out of.

  

And there was a moment of realization:

  

ThroughI'm assisting in some of the most memorable days that these people will have in their lives.

  

And to me, it's another gig.

  

Like Coachella, or even Pride. (That one was weeks back - whaddup Long Beach)

  

But it's sort of an antithesis yet reciprocal relationship between what I was doing at my last day job.

  

Behind a desk, listening to the same boring people complain about each other, every day.

  

I met ONE redeemable person during my time at Cobra

  

Doing this stagehand work allows me to be more extroverted, both physically and socially.

  

I'm learning how to network directly with people, in a way that opposite of how I already know how to do it.

  

The effects have taken hold, i'm noticing changes in my behavior and demeanor.

  

So it's cool.

  

It's fun work.

  

I'm out in the sun, all damn day. Working alongside people who are also hardworking.

  

Even dudes smaller and WAY stronger than me, but not in an obvious way.

  

These are people that I want to be like, and it's a complete 180 from 97% of my last job's environment.

  

Needless to say, I think it's a nice change of pace. Learning new areas is cool. Getting a workout and tan is cool. Learning how to bridge cultures and experiences while doing it all is also cool.

  

It hadn't dawned on me until I called a friend to ask for a lift home, in exchange for filling his tank and catching up.

  

We hung out for 3 hours and this dude is dropping the most insane reality bombs i've ever heard.

  

A friend i've known for 5 years and has made long strides in his life, who's also 30.

  

A bit older than me but i'm ahead of the game anyway, as I was soon to find out.

  

He broke down concepts on how he raises his 6 year old sun, works a landscaping job making as much as i was behind a desk, and makes the time to hit the gym nearly daily.

  

(He's at the gym now, presuming he's not stuck on the 91 West)

  

And after I explained the significance of this new job, he said, you've found your opposite.

  

Because I was physically inactive, introverted, not achieving the 'un-fuck-with-able' goals that men often have.

  

Digital Marketing is Yin Energy through and through.

  

Cunning, smooth, emotional.

  

But working under the sun with 6 other men all working toward a common goal, communicating, and building practical strength.

  

Pair that with the concept that BOTH share: you need to create networks, talk with people, get some quid pro quo action, and WORK CONSISTENTLY.

  

This Stagehand career is the Yang counterpart to my previous experience.

  

And not in a boring, monotonous way like warehousing. Robot mode.

  

I can feel myself growing in ways that I was never taught how.

  

I don't agree with most people who say you are your 5 closest friends.

  

But even if it's true, based on tonight.

  

I know at least one of them is a positive masculine influence.

  

Even as I sit here and type this, my forearms are burning from doing Farmer Walks with corner cubes made of steel.

  

I know that tonight I'll have my rest.

  

And tomorrow is a day I can dedicate to this screen, and make more money than I did physically.

  

This is my new game.

  

It's two games.

  

But it's actually one game.

  

Like most concepts in this reality.

  

It's both and neither, always sometimes.
