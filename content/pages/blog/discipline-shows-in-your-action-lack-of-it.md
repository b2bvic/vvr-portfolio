When you're followed by past action...

The last few weeks have brought to light some skills that I’ve ignored, in turn ignoring some passions that were created about a decade ago.

I’m referring to Search Engine Optimization.

I didn’t consider myself an SEO for the last 5 years because I was caught up in exploring new skillsets.

To name a few:

-   _Livestreaming & Direction_
-   _Moving 2,200 miles from home_
-   _Photography_
-   _Building with Webflow_
-   _Studying Real Estate_

So naturally, I was a little bit distracted. I like to study new things and if its the same for you then congratulations - we’re the same flavor of ADHD.

**What’s the point?**
None of these studies were absent of the fact that SEO has shaped the way I perceive the internet, beyond that it’s shaped the way I view connections between subjects, activity, people, even your ‘_inner_’ you to your ‘_outer_’ you.

All of it, influenced by the way I’ve learned how Search Engines interact with Websites, and how Humans interact with both, and how all of them change because of it.

SEO became a lens by which I peer into other professions, industries.

You stop seeing things from the professional’s view, and start seeing it from the perspective of a customer or client **_experiencing an issue and attempt to put it to words._**
**_There’s a level of investigation that takes place when you ‘go through the motions.’_**
Removing your perspective completely, emptying your cup, in order to trace the steps that so many others take on a daily basis.

It’s tranquil.

SEO to me is more that the web of the internet.

It’s the way the Master becomes the Student.

“But what does this matter to me?”

I assume you’re asking.

Chances are you’re a person that uses the internet. I’m near certain. But on another level, perhaps you’re a person with information to share. Or experience to divulge.

Maybe you have a story to tell or a product to sell.

If so, you know who to call.

Thanks for reading.
