This is something I find myself asking multiple times throughout a day.

  

Motivation is great, but it’s not as great as discipline or habit.

  

(I saw someone say that on twitter yesterday at it resonated to the core, but i cannot remember WHO said it)

  

Recently, I’ve found myself becoming less and less content with working a daily desk jockey job.

  

Even though I’m a Marketing Supervisor, overseeing all design, branding, and copywriting for this company, I do not enjoy it.

  

Reason being is my department has become the ‘babysitting’ section for the CEO, who believes that even a son who will be here for 3 weeks deserves a desk and some “responsibilities.”

  

This email isn’t being written to complain, though.

  

It’s being written to point out a problem with the current perspective I’m carrying.

  

3 years ago, I longed for a job of this exact caliber.

  

I wanted the desk.

  

I wanted the hourly wage.

  

I wanted the steady paycheck and schedule; because at the time, it was all that I could hope for.

  

Only now, after nearly 2 years of working within a corporate structure, am I reminded why I don’t work well within structures of this sort.

  

Creativity dies within structures like these.

  

Staring at the same bland walls, talking to the same negative people, overhearing the same conversations.

  

Day in, day out, week after week, month following month, for years and years.

  

There’s nothing about this place that inspires me, the work isn’t THAT creative, the workload is overbearing, and the results aren’t at all gratifying.

  

But i’ve finally identified: WHY

  

It’s because i’m not working towards my own dreams.

  

I’m working for a man who doesn’t understand the importance of aspects like copywriting, creative design, direct-response marketing.

  

He wants things done his way, with absolutely no input or work of his own, other than delegation of tasks.

  

And it’s people like me (at least when i was hired) that wanted to be a person who was handed a list of responsibilities to handle.)

  

No longer.

  

The reason i know this has become a problem is because there are new responsibilities coming in, but since i’m “locked in” at an hourly rate, there’s no amount of negotiation that is going to serve ME for MY highest good.

  

It’s my own fault, I didn’t know the worth of my work until I had a testing ground to prove it on.

  

They got me real cheap.

  

Lesson: know your worth.

  

I don’t deserve to get paid by the hour.

  

I deserve to get paid by the results of my writing, design, and effort.

  

So, i’m set on leaving.

  

I don’t know when, but I do know there are markets out there that will pay top dollar for a person who can create buzz on many fronts.

  

I’m a jack-of-all-trades, master of a few, when it comes to the marketing shit.

  

I can take another person’s vision, acquire their perspective, and write on their behalf.

  

I’m really fucking good at it.

  

But, it all goes back to discipline and habit.

  

I’ve settled on the habitual tendency of waking up early, driving for an hour, working for 8, driving for another 1.5 hours, then getting “tired” at home and crashing out before MY work is ever touched.

  

Yesterday I saw a tweet from Dennis Demori, a freelance marketing consultant who lives in Mexico City.

  

He said something along the lines of, “Take the Inches.”

  

To me, this means making the most of every waking moment I have.

  

So, each 10 minute break I get at work, every lunch, every moment I know someone isn’t watching me work while i’m in this office, will be dedicated to my own growth.

  

Even now, I’m typing this email before most of the staff arrived and before the CEO shows up.

  

I’m writing to improve my writing across the board.

  

I’ll be going to starbucks after work because once you’ve taken off your work clothes and shoes, the brain wants to stop and relax.

  

Well, this isn’t the time for that.

  

I’m making my own schedule.

  

I’ll need another workspace.

  

There are other benefits to this process:

  

-   Increased Focus on high ROI activities.
    
-   Increased productivity.
    
-   Increased amount of actual WORK rather than mental-masturbation.
    

  

If this world is really mine like I know it is, it isn’t enough just to ‘know’.

  

I need to fight.

  

That’s from Victor to Victor.

  

Now, from me to you, the reader?

  

I would suggest finding your fire. Your goals. Your intent.

  

And kicking the ass of anything that stands in your way.

  

Especially yourself.

  

Thank you for reading.

  

Until tomorrow,

  

— Victor Valentine Romo
