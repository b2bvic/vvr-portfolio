## First things first, I want you to take a deep breath.
‍
Follow me now:

-   **Exhale** the stale air within your lungs / diaphragm completely.
-   Start a slow **inhale**, focusing on directing your air into the diaphragm.
-   **Inflate** from the bottom-up, while realizing your lungs move in all 6 directions possible by this 3D Matrix.
-   As you reach your lung's capacity, **don't** lift your shoulders.
-   **Hold** for 3-5 seconds, exhale **slowly**, and **repeat** 3-5 times.

Congratulations, you know how to breathe like an infant.

_(And that's the point)_

Breath is the focal point of our lives, we constantly breathe, often on **auto-pilot** and very **shallow**.

It's the tool used to focus our attention.

There are a number of issues with the current modern mentality of breathing.

1.  We often forget to breathe with intention, to clear and move stagnat energy out of our bodies (science noted it as CO²), while bringing in the new energy (O²).
2.  We become irritated at the realization that we are breathing, and often take the entire experience for granted.
3.  We overeat, causing an enormous amount of internal pressure, preventing the lungs from operating in an environment that enables the process outright.

Breath is the perfect call / response, push / pull, pressure / vacuum, yin / yang.

Breath is the outline of our entire existence within this plane.

Breath is creation.

Breathing is dual in it's nature and there are two lungs.

Breath is the appreciation of your life.

Now, how can our breathing effect the level of output or our creative activity?

Well, as so duly noted by Zen Beast TAYLOR BUDD over on YouTube: [**_shallow breathing equates to shallow thoughts._**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6axzNcl4SnI)

If you don't innerstand the correlation, allow me to break it down:

Let's say you're in a particularly stressful situation, and before taking that extra 5 seconds to oxygenate your brain, stabilize your heartrate, and relax the cortisol response, you decide to fly off the handle and go with the first thought that pops into your head:

You're very likely to create a situation that's worse for yourself, whether it's recognized immediately or long after, I'd bet my silver it's worse.

(Reflect on examples in your life where something like this occurred, unless you're a Christ, I'm sure you've done it [we all have {yes me too}])

But, if you were to take that extra breath, allow the gift of life to flood your internal response, your external creation from such a situation

Take a breath.

And another.

‍Okay, let's continue:

So, breathing, it's pretty important, wouldn't you say?

It's the exact mechanism that opens up the space for your 'thinking' mind to determine a **better outcome** or response to stressors.

It's a stabilizing force, it's a renewal, it's a **gift**.

It could be the filter you need to take the environment around you and turn it into your creative play-space.

Don't just take my word for it, either.

Try it next time a coworker begins to complain, or when you accidentally stub your toe, or if someone hurts your feelings:

Breathe, offer yourself that moment of **reflection** and **relief**, and get back to it.

Utilize that creative flame within. Offer guidance, support, love, _especially for yourself._

Now, how can breathing tie into your goals?

Well, let's get into a tactic I learned around 17 — **SMART Goals:**
SMART goals are a metric in order to determine the effectiveness of your ambitions. They follow these parameters:

1.  **S**pecific
2.  **M**easurable
3.  **A**cheivable
4.  **R**elevant
5.  **T**ime-Bound

Utilizing your breath, allow your brain to intake an absurd amount of oxygen, zoom out from the problems in your life, and figure out what needs to be done in order to move forward.

This is a level of clarity not many people cultivate. Modern man is always on the move, always in a rush, always wondering what to do _next_ rather than trying to **be** in moment.

Set some time aside and practice your breathing.

Write out your goals.

Set a timeline for yourself.

Remain flexible as new situations arise.

Remember to breathe
