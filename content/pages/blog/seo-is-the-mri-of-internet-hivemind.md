# SEO is the MRI of Internet Hivemind

Everyone knows that search engine optimization is the monitoring of  trends on the internet, and optimizing for those search trends themselves.

When you perform good SEO, you're essentially tracking the thoughts of the internet through analytics.

To put it another way, you're tapping into the brain waves of the digital hive mind that we know as the world wide web.

Websites are the synapses.
Links are the neural pathways.
Traffic are the electrical impulses that travel through them.

Analytics (& their study) are no different than a neurologist that is pairing prefrontal cortex activations to reasoning.

## Search Engine Optimization, is a lot like the way the brain maps and remaps connections due to our experiences.

When a website loads quickly, there's a connection.
When you find that piece of content that satisfies your curiosity, there's a connection.
When you reach the resource that itches that scratch, there's a connection.

Brains conduct themselves through electrical impulse. Websites do the same thing.
Brains create connections through relationships. Websites do the same thing.

## To recall a memory is no different that a browser cache.

You're not remembering the event itself, you're remembering the last time you remembered it.

You're not loading a website each time, you're replacing elements with locally-stored cached assets.

The implications grow as the metaphor does.

Hundreds of years ago, when sweeping behavior begins to duplicate itself across a population of brains, it was called stress-induced mass hysteria (see: Dancing Plague of 1518)

Today, when sweeping behavior begins to duplicate itself across a population of brains, we call it "memes" and "tiktoks" (or "viral", "vines", "tweets", etc.)

Search Engine Optimization is nothing more than changes of mentality tracked at scale through browsing behaviors, habits, & trends, while planning for your content to become part of that swell in accepted behavior.

To put it another way, each of us individually is now a neuron, in a higher-dimensional intelligence, acting upon its own collective consciousness.
