Musings On Travel & Self-Optimization

It’s been 16 days.

That’s how long I’ve spent in Raleigh.

It’s been an interesting 16 days.

I’m going to spare a majority of the details, as they will eventually get distilled into further writings and lessons that I am finally now coming around to writing.

There’s a certain familiarity to Raleigh that reminds me a lot of Riverside.

For one, the longer roads that run through my hometown, are windy two-lane roads that often gets congested.

(That happens in Raleigh, too.)

The amount of driven minds that are out here, are unlike those that are typically found in California, I suppose this is due to the proximity of other prominent East Coast locations. 

For those wondering, I’m not experiencing any amount of culture shock, although I have needed to adjust to a few differences in the way others communicate and relate to one another out here. 

Meyers-Briggs, is one of the major ones. Everyone knows their type, the way they think, how they fit into different social situations. 

Growing up, I’ve consistently tested into INTJ, Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Thinking (T), Judgment (J).

The month leading up to leaving California has been ENFP, Extraversion (E), Intuition (N), Feeling (F), Perception (P)

But by people in my proximity, having met me only since arriving in this city, claim me to INFJ, Introversion (I), Intuition (N), Feeling (F), Judgment (J).

I don’t really know what any of this means, but I do know that having the flexibility to explore different applications of my personality is proving to be useful.

If there’s anything that I’ve learned since leaving home, it’s that a person may have to rely on their ability to improvise rather than plan, because life rarely goes according to plan. You can save that time by never planning and analyzing. 

Leaving the narratives of our histories is an experience everyone needs to do once in their life. There’s nothing more freeing than having the ability to draw the best of yourself in every moment. Even if the new environment doubts you, they will be proven wrong after only one attempt.

There’s a level of missing bias that allows you to really test yourself in new ways.

I taught myself a new Content Management System (CMS) and Visual Web Builder.

I never once protested not learning it, but I took the time yesterday to experiment with it a bit and get a good grasp on how the program works.

Which means that I’m done having to work with Wordpress and Elementor.

And I just might start designing websites again.

But that’s for another time. 

Thanks for reading,
