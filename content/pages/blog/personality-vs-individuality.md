Personality vs. Individuality:

'Facing Yourself' vs. Emptying Indoctrination

Not saying that Ego isn't important, (because it is), but this is one of the many pitfalls that approach people trying to 'enlighten' themselves.

Let's get into it a little bit:

Before I begin, two distinctions need to be made:

Personality ‚Äî The cumulative representation of that which doesn‚Äôt really exist. Often referred to as our ‚Äòmasks‚Äô. The caricature of your 'character'.

Individuality ‚Äî The unique vibration / creation that is the essence of YOU.

There is no one on Earth who is here to do what you will, otherwise, you wouldn‚Äôt be here.

Your contribution when in such alignment with an activity, the ‚Äòyou‚Äô falls away, embodying the action.

Whether it be creative, a craft, or another form of meditative action.

When one 'faces themselves', they have accepted the illusion of Ego.

When one 'empties themselves', it is realized that Ego is a falsety (and although will never be removed completely), it will be dampened dramatically.

For example:

If a person is great at 'fake' smiles (no heart, no eyes, just an exercise of the lips ‚Äî smile lines are a basic indication) they are 'performing' a protection from Ego.

A front.

A mask.

A keep-at-a-distance attitude for fear of revealing a deeper part of self.

If the same person also 'fakes' tears, for dramatic effect, manipulation, or otherwise, both of these actions will work in tandem to reinforce the Ego's facade.

To 'face yourself' is to accept a facade as reality.

To accept the mythos of your own being.

A shallow/hollow life.

When a person 'empties' self, there is no acceptance of any cumulative illusion of their existence:

‚Ä¢ Indoctrinated Patterns of Thought

‚Ä¢ Beliefs / Desires / Habits / Fears etc

‚Ä¢ the 'Fuck You' voice within

One realizes these are nothing more than falsities, forced patterns.

The opposite of 'Love' is not 'Hate'.

In fact, these are more similar than most assume.

The opposite of 'Love' is 'Faked Love'

The opposite of 'Compassion' is 'Cultivated / Circumstantial Compassion'

The opposite of BE-ing is the 'performance' of being.

Mask on? Mask off.

Emptying self does not extinguish Ego, but it does dampened the effects within our daily lives / actions.

A person does not say, "I am a realized person" (that's Ego)

A realized person simply ‚Äî IS.

Similar to the Sun rising; it needs not announce it's presence.

It just is.

Once individuality is realized, one can start to embody the uniqueness of their 'role' within this world:

‚Ä¢ A loving heart

‚Ä¢ A hand to hold

‚Ä¢ An ear to listen

‚Ä¢ A song to sing

‚Ä¢ A dance to dance

‚Ä¢ An empire to build

These do not happen what a person is overrun by Ego.

As a musician, i've learned to embody a phrase:

"Serve the music."

It's when a person sets aside their desires to play a Lead part, Solo, or other 'noteworthy' (lol) addition in order to develop and cultivate the sound of the WHOLE.¬†

Rather than a focus on self.

AKA 'Divas'.

When one can dampen the Ego, quiet it down, put it on time out, one begins to embody the purest form of themselves.

Embody your unique vibration.¬†

We need you.
