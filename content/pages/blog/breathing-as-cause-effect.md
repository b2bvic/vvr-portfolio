Follow me now:

-   **Exhale** the stale air within your lungs / diaphragm completely.
-   Start a slow **inhale**, focusing on directing your air into the diaphragm.
-   **Inflate** from the bottom-up, while realizing your lungs move in 6 directions
-   As you reach your lung’s capacity, **don’t** lift your shoulders.
-   **Hold** for 3-5 seconds, exhale **slowly**, and **repeat** 3-5 times.

Congratulations, you know how to breathe like an infant.

Breath is the focal point of our lives, we constantly breathe, often on **auto-pilot** and very **shallow**.

It’s the tool used to focus our attention.

There are a number of issues with the modern mentality of breathing:

1.  We often forget to breathe with intention
2.  We have no amount of core control
3.  We suffer our parasympathetic nervous system

Are you a bit of a jumpy person when you hear loud noises? Are you afraid of surprises? Do they ‘**get on _your nerves_**’? That’s your nervous system.

Breath is…

-   call + response
-   push + pull
-   pressure + vacuum

Breath is the outline of our entire existence.

Can our breathing effect our creative activity?

_Allow me to break it down:_

Let’s say you’re in a particularly stressful situation, and before taking that extra 5 seconds to oxygenate your brain, stabilize your heartrate, and relax the cortisol response, you decide to fly off the handle and go with the first thought that pops into your head.

You’re very likely to create a situation that’s worse for yourself.

Breathing is the exact mechanism that opens up the space for your ‘thinking’ mind to determine a **better outcome or response to stressors.**
It’s a stabilizing force, it’s a renewal, it’s a **gift**.

It could be the filter you need to take the environment around you and turn it into your creative play-space.

Don’t just take my word for it, either.

Try it next time you accidentally stub your toe or if someone hurts your feelings:

Breathe, offer yourself that moment of **reflection** and **relief**, and get back to it.

Utilize that creative flame within.

Offer guidance, support, love, _especially for yourself._

Now, how can breathing tie into your goals?

Well, let’s get into a tactic I’ve used for a decade— **SMART Goals:**
**SMART goals** are a metric to determine the effectiveness of your ambitions. They follow these parameters:

1.  **S**pecific
2.  **M**easurable
3.  **A**chievable
4.  **R**elevant
5.  **T**ime-Bound

Set some time aside and practice your breathing. Write out your goals. Set a timeline for yourself. [Remain flexible as new situations arise](http://valentine.media/meet?utm_campaign=Methods%20%F0%9F%A4%9D%20Madness&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
