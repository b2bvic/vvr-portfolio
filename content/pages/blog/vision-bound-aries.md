Hello and welcome to Moon’s Day.

  

Or “UGH i HATE mondays” day.  
  
So,

  

Chances are you follow me on twitter and you may have noticed there were a few changes along how I present myself on the platform.

  

I decided to become a cacariture of the ‘spiritual’ twitter community. 

  

I did so by purchasing [SpiritualTwitter.com](http://spiritualtwitter.com/) and building a website to spoof the practices of most of these people.

  

There was an alternative twitter account that I started a year ago or so, that was meant to serve as a ‘truer’ alternative to what I would be posting on the primary account.

  

[@________victor](https://twitter.com/________victor) is the Vision of Aries

Visionary & Boundaries.

  

I’m very interested in word-splitting and etymology.

  

It occured to me that my subconscious was intentionally trying to have me innerstand the differences between these two viewpoints that I carry.

  

On one end, there’s this fire I carry into my vision for creating a life I want to live.

  

On the other, I’m learning there are certain boundaries which shouldn’t be crossed.

  

It wasn’t until I had a consultation session with [Dr. Taylor Burrowes](https://drtaylorburrowes.com/) that I was able to dig a bit deeper into this perspective.

  

You see, I rationalized the starting of ‘Spiritual Twitter’ in order to offer ‘guidance’ to anyone who would inquire about those services. 

  

But here’s what I was really doing:

  

I was looking to provide the answers to other people, which I couldn’t provide myself.

  

I consider myself an intuitive person, but honestly, this was nothing more than a distraction from the inner-work that I should be doing.

  

In fact, my subconscious has been trying to get my attention for over a month now.

  

Since starting this email list, I’ve covered a number of different subjects, the most recent ones being on Indoctrination, Self-Hypnosis, and the Mind Mantras which create the environment around us everyday.

  

I’ve realized there were some deep-seated issues I had been ignoring.

  

The primary of which: is how I view police officers.

  

It was only an email or two back that I wrote about my experience with police while I was 17.

  

And there was a situation that happened with my dad about a month ago, in which I should have called ‘911’ because it was life-threatening, but I assumed I could maintain control over the outcome (I couldn’t, my car was nearly wrecked, I almost drove off a bridge.)

  

Are you ready to read one of the longest-standing indoctrinations I’ve held over myself?

  

I assumed police officers would never protect in those situations, because I was so accustomed to being on the ‘other side’ of the Law.

  

With this in mind, it brought up an interesting postulate:

  

If I’m putting out a specific vibration against police officers, in that I assume they’re authoritative, manipulative, and overall the scum of humanity,

  

How would the cops serve the function of ‘protecting and serving’?

  

They wouldn’t.

  

In fact, I’m willing to bet that police are trained to pick up on personal bias when it comes to communication.

  

They know how to read body language, they know how to notice the small details, how to read between the lines.

  

Some of the hardest patterns to break are the ones that have served some sort of purpose for survival.

  

I grew up with a criminal father, who continuously did ‘illegal’ activities, and taught me to view police within a certain light.

  

And because of that, he was able to goad a response out of me that caused a cool couple thousand in damages to my only form transportation.

  

So, there are two sides to every story, and for the longest time I only looked at one side.

  

Now, I know the purpose behind creating two separate twitter accounts.

  

One is meant to be ludicrous in order to teach about Patterns, Perspectives, and other Principles within this reality.

  

The other is meant to reinforce the boundaries that i’ve only recently learned were there.

  

It’s okay to withdraw your energy from those who try to take advantage of a situation or willingness to help heal.

  

But it’s not okay to completely avoid the work altogether because it’s easier.

  

Knowing this, I have begun to utilize tools that will help me become the man that I never was able to look up to as I grew from a small child.

  

And in that, my father will internally realize that I have surpassed him in his own capabilities.  
  
He’s going to know, “I didn’t teach him that.”

  

This is what it means to close karmic cycles.

  

There are some lessons our parents don’t teach us.

  

It’s in that absence of being taught that we learn.

  

Take into account all that i’ve written about over the last two weeks.

  

Wonder if there was a greater plan to it all along.

  

Because I was sure surprised to discover the lessons hidden within my words.

  

When you discover your purpose, your purpose becomes discovery.

  

Contemplate on that.

  

You are loved. 

  

You are beautiful.

  

You are free.

  

Your friend,

  

— Victor V.
