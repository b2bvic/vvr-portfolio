You ever find a rant from your younger self that is so good you have to respond?

Let’s get into this.

Here’s something 2015 Victor shared on Facebook:

“I have an issue with being called “political” when i speak of the world in a way that isn’t typical.

There’s nothing political about being aware of your country’s history, atrocities, and true intentions. As a citizen I have a responsibility to keep my government in check. That’s what I’ve been taught in school and have read in the Constitution. 

To live in a country that provides such an opportunity and ignore the millions of people who were killed or enslaved, the countries that have been invaded or occupied, or the structural violence that perpetuates struggle is simply disgusting.

Take into consideration the issues you already ignore and multiple them by ten. There’s far too much you don’t know.

To call someone who is aware of the truth “political” is trying to subdue important discussions that can lead to solutions. Staying willfully ignorant in this day and age is inexcusable. I take a proactive approach because I know there are reasons behind everything.

I just can’t ignore the facts:

The US gives billions in support to Israel while Detroit looks like a 3rd world country, politicians receive more money from lobbying than their payroll, veterans come home to find they can’t afford medication or even see a doctor, more money has been wasted on a failed fighter jet than we’ve ever put into education, infrastructure, or social programs, 180+ countries have US military bases, the poor are blamed as a financial strain while companies destroying our only planet receive corporate welfare, inflation is run amok, the housing bubble is worse now than it was in 2008, Saudi Arabia beheads over 100 people and they’re our ‘allies’ while ISIS beheads 4 people and they’re evil, the police have killed over 1000 people this year, refugees are being displaced due to OUR bombs and we have the audacity to call THEM a “threat,” the military is predominantly poor or minorities and we wonder why congress is so quick for “boots on the ground,” children are going hungry while Commanders are planning a drone strike that will kill foreign children, delivered by machinery that cost more to design than simply feeding them would, but we fight their wars, bail their bands out, pay their debts for pieces of paper with no value, pay for rising food, gas, education, and health prices with stale wages and THEY have the audacity to say WE’RE the problem, they stole your social security, rights, and spy on you for a ‘war on terror’ they’ve created, they’ve filled your television, radio, and newspapers with crap it’s still consumed willingly, images dehumanizing those who are different from you, to make you forget that you’re part of a bigger collective than yourself, to keep you distracted and disillusioned while they get away with the world.

Wake up and look around. The world is bursting at the seams trying to get your attention while you decide which filter makes your meal look most appetizing.

Just because your complacency with ignorance is common, doesn’t make it normal. Or moral.”

Whew.

That was a lot, i know.

I wasn’t much of a copywriter then so I didn’t really like to split my paragraphs, I wanted that tension to rise in the long sentence.

So what’s the takeaway? What’s the rebuttal?

To put it simply: I’ve reduced responsibility of my world, and they way I envision it, to JUST me.

I’m not a person who’s obligated to hold government responsible. That was indoctrination.

No piece of paper is every going to secure myself as I am capable of.

Now, when it comes to that long ass list of “truths,” to be quite honest, I don’t give a fuck about them anymore.

If it’s not something within my power that I can effect directly, it’s ignored.

I know there are plenty of ways I can impact the world with my abilities, skillset, and talent.

However, none of that is going to matter if I hold all of these concepts within my mind.

I’m going for optimal creative ability, and that requires cognition.

I liken it to RAM on a computer.

That stands for Random Access Memory.

There’s a certain train of thought that I am following along here.

Media, and all of the distraction material that is laid out for us to consume with our attention, is fighting the natural curiosities and inspiration that is normally at the forefront of our minds.

I have a few friends that, upon hearing the plans for myself, shut down and automatically sound reducing their communication to unresearched soundbytes.

They haven’t done any research.

They haven’t objectively looked at why they feel a certain way.

They just repeat the program.

And that program is fear.

Fear, in this application, is the most useless method one can utilize.

However, there are two different types of fear.

There is the fear that is programmed through media, as I’ve just explained.

The other type of Fear is a facing of the unknown.

It’s the type of fear that arises after an inspiring idea.

It’s usually the first thought to doubt your ability as well.

This is the fear that the heart can utilize into creation.

Don’t get me wrong, it may seem impossible at first, but when you learn how to dive into fear which beholds you to a certain mindset, you’ll find that there’s no such thing as failure.

You’re continuously learning about what DOESN’T work.

That’s it.

The real failure comes when you’ve not made an attempt outright.

So, to my 4 years-younger self, I have this to say:

You talk a lot, kid.

But what have you DONE?

Your complacency with inaction is sickening.

It’s not enough to type fancy words.

Get your lazy ass up and do something.

Well, that rounds out 1,000.

Go out and fail at something today.

You are strong.

You are free.

You are loved.

Thank you for reading,

Your friend,

Victor V.
