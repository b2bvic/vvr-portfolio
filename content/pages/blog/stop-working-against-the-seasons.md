Humans have been following the cycles of time since the beginning.

But it’s very surprising to see people who think they’re ‘new idea’ to change their life should happen in the dead of Winter.

Then wonder why they’ve fallen flat on their face by the time March rolls around.

Think about this for a moment.

We work alongside the Sun. This should give you a major clue as to the projects you take on within yourself or in your career.

The Seasons As Systems

**Spring:** New growth. New beginnings. Nature is waking up to begin the great work. The planting of seeds.

**Summer:** The days are long. The work is long. Toil. Sweat. Suffer. Sow. Grow.

**Autumn:** The reaping. You’ve taken all previous season to extend. Now’s the time to collect on your earnings.

**Winter:** Death. Stillness. A lack of motivation. Survival.

When you honor the seasons, you honor a system that has been crafted over millennia to support the entire biosphere.

Humans are so daft to believe their beliefs have anything to do with Natural Law.

They rarely do. They are often folly.

Best case scenario it’s a simple mistake.

Worst case scenario people are intentionally being misled about the environments around them.

If you’ve felt yourself ‘waking up’ in the last few weeks - it’s because everything else around you is waking up too.

Run with it. Carry the momentum of the seasons around you.

**You’ll go so much farther.**

**You’ll do so much more.**

You don’t even have to take my word for it.

The answers are all around you.
