Hello and welcome to Woden’s Day,

I’ve been toying with Zen lately, because it’s really piqued my interest with how they observe reality, and utilizing tools to decipher how the human mind works.

Something that sort of struck me as odd, is the idea that actions you’re supposed to take part in really don’t feel like any effort.

They just happen.

I had to ask myself, what is it in my life that requires too much action for the amount of output, or in other words, what are the maximum ROI activities I can take part in?

One of those answers, was definitely not twitter.

And i’m going to explain why.

Now, i’m more than aware of the possibilities for making money, optimizing scheduling and automation, it’s something that I already do for the company I work for.

And while i’m good at it, i’m not nearly as extroverted as some of the more successful people i’ve noticed.

Mainly because i’m not that sort of person.

I have experience reading news on camera, I have experience in public speaking, so on some level, I innately understand how to perform these actions.

But that’s the point right there, performance.

Performance requires a certain level of character, both ‘to play’ and to ‘dis-play’.

This is something that doesn’t require effort on my part because it’s not a whole lot different from talking to myself internally.

In fact, it goes further than that, because chances are you’re reading this internally with an assumption of my tonality, or utilizing your own tonal variation for these words.

In a way, I'm speaking from the ‘internal’ parts of my brain, directly into the ‘internal’ parts of yours.

This is one of the manipulative reasons behind marketing.

Slogans and commercials utilize a direct approach with internalizing the ‘need’ for a product in order to live a certain lifestyle, have a certain status, or to gain a certain advantage over those who don’t.

Playing to my strengths means utilizing the mediums which are suited for my methods of communication.

This usually deals with 1-on-1 interaction, long form writing, times of contemplation, and times of creation.

Referring back to why Zen still interests me, I’ve associated with my neurosis long enough.

There’s no goal with this email, there’s no real point.

The point is to write and allow whatever meanings buried deep within my subconscious to be released in a healthy way.

Twitter wasn’t the optimal choice for me because I found myself becoming addicted to the ‘clout’, the chase.

To chase inherently means the goal is too elusive to ever reach.

Although no progress happens overnight, I know enough about internet marketing to cater to my certain ‘style’ of conveying information and content.

In no way will these methods make me rich.

But that’s never been a goal for me anyway.

My goal is freedom.

And beyond that: expression.

Finally: connection.

So, with this in mind, i’d like to open up the conversation with you.

You, the person reading my internal monologue with your internal voice.

In no way should my experience be prescribed to your life as though I have the answers.

But chances are, if we work together, I can set my problems aside for a moment and offer guidance towards yours.

I know my path.

Due to this: I can point to yours.

In an objective manner.

Because although I love you, and can hold the space for you, I cannot live your life for you.

The hardest part is starting.

Or even reaching out.

But realize this is my effort to reach out to you, first.

I’m simply asking for reciprocity.

My time will not be charged for, since I am now properly utilizing my own creative output, I know the compensation for my real work will come when I’m ready.

Anyways,

That’s it.

Remember to breathe, each breath being the renewal of opportunity.

Low & slow.

Here we go.

Thank you for reading.

—Victor
