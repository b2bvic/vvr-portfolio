SEO is such a vast subject that you will spend 80% of your time getting to 20% mastery alone YouTube University can only take you so far if you don't understand how information is weighed against the selection and order of your words in the search bar A local business owner I met on Saturday told me that he spent "hundreds of hours studying this stuff" And you know what? It showed:- Lean WordPress build- Site speed clocked - Grasp of SEO concepts (metadata, schema, ranking) But do you know what else he had?

Some very glaring but easy-to-fix problems:- Missing Descriptions- Titles Too Long / Short- STOLEN CONTENT FROM OTHER SITES "I copied some stuff but left the author and links in there as credit WAT. You can't do that. Here's why: - The content is crawled somewhere else- With the same exact backlink structure- To affiliate links that aren't his But you know the crazy part? My guy was STILL ranking top 10 SERP for every original article.

Even with blatant duplication. Have we learned anything? Let's recap: 1. Teaching yourself SEO creates blind spots2. Blind spots due to lack of search engine skill3. 80% is done correct4. 20% is worst shit you'll ever do to a website in your career There's a good chance his website traffic increases once the duplicated content is removed and metadata is brought in line with current standards. Then just running for the hills with a content writer.

Don't underestimate a second pair of eyes. An hour of my time may save your business years of frustration.
