As most all of you know, I moved out to Raleigh late last year to begin work with a marketing company. It wouldn’t be longer than 3 months before I realized this position was not what I was promised.

Long story short, sparing you the details of wage theft & fraud, I quit the company when it became clear that the person spearheading the operation was not interested in fulfilling their obligations, of which, enticed me to move in the first place. Needless to say, I haven’t been paid by this person and I don’t expect to.

All that being said, myself and a few others came together to build a company from the ashes of that last shit-show. With the sociopath completely cut out of the picture, we have gotten the ball rolling in making up for that previous company’s lack. Creating a powerhouse of a team which, in only a few short weeks, has done more for clients than that previous company ever did.

This new company is Remarq (@BeRemarqable), of which, I am Vice President of Marketing.

Am I still taking a large risk by doing this when already being burned by one company? Yes.

But I believe, wholeheartedly, that I have connected with the individuals that I feel bring equal part in the company’s success.

I know that together, we can have our retribution, not being tied to a complete sham.

I miss you all. But I’m not staying discouraged. 

I’ve lived through worse, with less. 

But I am excited for what the future holds, and I trust the people I know work with to bring equal tenacity in bringing our vision to fruition.
