# WordPress vs. Webflow: The Truth About Which Is Better, And When

Choosing the right content management system (CMS) is an essential step for any business looking to create or revamp their website. Two popular choices that often come up for consideration are WordPress and Webflow. This article aims to delve into the pros and cons of each platform and explore how factors like staff size, tech stack, and company goals play a part in the decision-making process.

# How Staff Size, Tech Stack, and Company Goals Play a Factor

## Staff Size

Smaller teams often have fewer resources to allocate toward website maintenance and development. In this context, choosing a user-friendly and low-maintenance CMS is imperative.

**WordPress**: WordPress is known for its vast community and the plethora of tutorials and resources available. This makes it a popular choice for small teams with limited web development knowledge.

**Webflow**: Webflow is designed to be approachable for non-coders, making it suitable for small businesses with limited technical resources. Designers can create visually appealing websites with Webflow without needing a developer's support.

## Tech Stack

The technology stack refers to the collection of technologies—programming languages, frameworks, tools, servers, and more—used for building a project. The chosen CMS should integrate seamlessly with the existing tech stack to ensure smooth functionality.

**WordPress**: WordPress is built on PHP and uses MySQL for database management. If your team has experience with these technologies or prefers open-source software, WordPress might be a better fit.

**Webflow**: Webflow is designed with modern web development technologies and has built-in hosting, making it a suitable choice for those looking to avoid the complexities of managing multiple components in their tech stack.

## Company Goals

The CMS you choose should align with your company's objectives and scale to accommodate future growth.

**WordPress**: Ideal for businesses that prioritize content creation, blogging, or SEO, as WordPress has built-in blogging features and supports various plugins for SEO, content management, and more.

**Webflow**: Webflow's visual design tools, integrated hosting, and focus on producing responsive designs make it a suitable choice for companies whose primary goal is to create visually impressive, responsive websites.

# Choosing the Right CMS for Your Company (or Yourself)

## Maintenance

**Pros**: As an open-source platform, WordPress is continuously updated and maintained by the community. There is a wide range of plugins available for various functionalities.

**Cons**: Frequent updates and keeping numerous plugins up-to-date can be time-consuming, and security vulnerabilities can arise if updates are not managed properly.

## Own-ability

**Pros**: WordPress offers the flexibility to host your website on a server of your choice and gives you full ownership over the site's design, functionality, and content.

**Cons**: Ownership comes with the responsibility of maintaining and securing your site, domain, and hosting.

# Webflow

## Maintenance

**Pros**: Webflow offers built-in hosting, automatic updates, and takes care of website maintenance, which simplifies website upkeep and reduces the need for dedicated technical resources.

**Cons**: Limited options for third-party services or plugins might require manual implementation or compromise on certain desired features.

## Own-ability

**Pros**: Webflow users have creative control over their website's design and can achieve a custom look without having to write code.

**Cons**: Webflow hosting is required for CMS functionality, giving users less control over the actual code and backend components of the website.

# The Differences Between Them

Ultimately, the choice between WordPress and Webflow will depend on your team's size, technical expertise, company goals, and preferences regarding maintenance and own-ability. WordPress excels in flexibility, customizability, and content management, while Webflow is known for its visual design tools and user-friendly interface. By considering these factors, you can make an informed decision to choose a CMS that aligns well with your company's long-term vision and objectives.
