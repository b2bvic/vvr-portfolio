#### Water is the cradle of life for every animal and plant on Earth; too often it is regarded as something that could be done away with or replaced.

We have reached a point in human history where many consider water as a natural resource that could be done away with. Governments and corporations no longer consider how much damage can be done to this precious resource.

## Concerns Of Water Quality

In August 2015, about [3 million gallons of water waste spilled](https://www.epa.gov/goldkingmine/fate-transport-analysis) from the Gold King Mine after contractors were hired by the Environmental Protection Agency to excavate an old mine. The waste was laden with more than 875,000 pounds of Arsenic, Cadmium, Lead, and other heavy metals and was transported through the Animas and San Juan River system to Lake Powell.

It goes without saying that this was an environmental disaster for all local communities who depended upon this river and its tributaries to drink from. Unfortunately, the river is still contaminated to this day and the water there remains undrinkable.

A reality not yet considered by most Americans is that tap water is not always much better. In Flint, Michigan, the pipes are still so rusted over that many of the children and population suffer from Lead poisoning. Relying on spending an exuberant amount of money on bottled water to do simple everyday tasks like cooking, cleaning, or bathing.

This has been the reality for this community since 2014, though it was the year before that the [Detroit Water and Sewerage Department sent Flint a letter terminating their water service contract](http://www.freep.com/pages/interactives/flint-water-crisis-timeline/). Which led officials to source the local water from areas that have undergone Fracking.

How can a natural resource that so essential to life on this planet be regarded with such carelessness?

Nestle, one of the largest corporations in the world, has not had a permit to collect water in drought-stricken California for over 25 years, yet it still collecting MILLIONS of gallons per year. This bottled water is then sold to Flint, Michigan in order for them to just survive.

Is the picture becoming clear to you? Water is the most essential natural resource to humans and it is [regarded as a commodity](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-privatisation-of-water-nestle-denies-that-water-is-a-fundamental-human-right/5332238).

> _Chairman Of Nestle, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Believes That “Access To Water Is Not A Public Right.”_

America’s entire water infrastructure is under attack on a daily basis, from the [prescriptions drugs flushed into toilets](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/drugs-in-the-water), to spills from mines, or just general disregard of responsibility by government or corporations. It’s treated as a resource that should be private, even though the damage that’s done soon becomes everyone’s problem.

[The United States can boast a grade of D+](http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/drinking-water/overview) when it comes to the drinking water infrastructure and quality. Although as a first world country, we should be grateful to have water on command, no human should be forced to rely upon a poor infrastructure or an even worse corporate view of privatization.

So, as a citizen of this country, and in some states bound by water laws that restrict gathering rainwater on private property, what are the options for drinking water that is healthy for you?

## Filtration Of Heavy Metals

The first and most obvious solution would be to install some sort of water filtration system for your home. Brands that immediately come to mind are Pur or Britta and their respected filters, although they may filter substances like Lead or other heavy metals, it doesn’t address pollutants like pharmaceuticals or [fluoride](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/community-water-fluoridation.html). Fluoride is a common substance found in water, rationalized by the reasoning that it prevents tooth decay, though [studies regarding American teeth health](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/DataStatistics/FindDataByTopic/DentalCaries/DentalCariesAdults20to64.htm) have been contradicting.

If you were to check the back of your fluoridated toothpaste, it warns to call poison control if ingested. This is the same amount of fluoride that present in a typical glass of tap water.

How would one be okay to drink, cook, and bathe with if you can’t swallow toothpaste? This is logically inconsistent and should be discerned as trouble by anyone who regards their health as a priority.

## Benefits Of Drinking Healthy Water

It should remain obvious that drinking higher quality water will lead to an improvement in personal health and appearance.

The human body is composed primarily of water before any other substance; in our bones, muscles, internal organs, ligaments, and blood all rely on water to function properly.

In today’s fast-paced world it’s easy to forget to drink the proper amount of water, not only is the body usually dehydrated from the start, but the fluids that are going into our bodies as a replacement are full of sugars, chemicals, and an acidity that create imbalance within ourselves.

Let’s take a look at some of the benefits that come from drinking clean, non-fluoridated, and even alkaline waters.

### Improved Energy Level And Brain Function

Studies conducted by Human Performance Laboratory, University of Connecticut showed that even [mild dehydration in women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190027) had damaging effects on cognitive function. This study discovered that fluid loss 1.36% after exercise impaired both mood and concentration, while also increasing the frequency headaches.

A similar study conducted by the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine in Dallas look at [dehydration effects for young men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21736786). Researchers discovered that fluid loss of 1.59% was detrimental to working memory and increased feeling of anxiety and fatigue.

A 1-3% fluid loss equals about 1.5-4.5 pounds of body weight loss for a 150lb person. This can easily occur through normal daily activities, extreme heat, or simply neglecting to drink water regularly. There are many other studies that support these findings in age ranges from infancy to the elderly. It should go without saying that water is easily the most vital yet most overlooked aspect of bodily health.

### Removal Of Fluoride And Other Heavy Metals

As mentioned earlier in the article, fluoride has been added to municipal water supplies by the Federal Government (without the consent of the masses), this fluoride can wreak havoc on important bodily functions and glands. Other heavy metals are also consistent in the water supply. Chromium-3, 6 has been reported in the water supply around the United States. Although Trivalent and Hexavalent Chromium occurs naturally, they end up in municipal supplies due to irresponsible toxic waste practices.

[A 2008 study conducted by National Institutes of Health Public Health Service found](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/lt_rpts/tr546.pdf) that “Male and female rats exposed to sodium dichromate dihydrate had carcinomas of the mouth, but none occurred in the control rats. Male and female mice receiving sodium dichromate dihydrate had greatly increased rates of cancer of the small intestine.”

The control mice, or those that didn’t have this compound added to the water, saw no cancers whatsoever.

It should become abundantly clear that our water supply is in danger of poisoning us in the long run. Utilizing a natural spring water source or installing a home water purification system that can handle these heavy metals are some of the easiest ways to reduce the risk of any health issues.

Although reports of Aluminium being the main variable of Alzheimer’s are convoluted, a 2011 study conducted by Neural Dynamics Research Group, University of British Columbia found that [Aluminium needed only very small amounts to begin interfering with brain function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21157018), and over the course of a lifetime, can “favor its selective accumulation in brain tissues.”

Take any and all precautions that could prevent this from occurring in your own body, these include ingesting Iodine, Tamarind, Boron, or sweating intensely in a Dry Sauna.

Taking these precautions will also prevent your Pineal Gland from being calcified, which is the next topic on this list.

### Decalcify The Pineal Gland

Reiterating a point made earlier regarding fluoride, the poisonous heavy metal that’s found in most toothpastes and drinking water, has led to the discovery that it calcifies the Pineal Gland.

A study conducted in 1985 by the British Medical Association found that out of the 750 patients tested, 394 had calcium build-up on the Pineal Gland (also known as the 3rd eye by many Ancient Cultures).

This correlated with a [defective sense of direction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1419179/), the study further extrapolates on this idea by running a parallel study in pigeons. Findings suggested that, “pineal calcification also leads to a reduction in homing abilities. The findings suggested that the pineal gland plays an important part in directional sense and that damage to the gland, as indicated by calcification, causes defective sense of direction – perhaps by altering the intrinsic intracranial electromagnetic environment and thus affecting the magnetite response mechanism.”

The most commonly-referred methods of decalcification include daily meditation, sun gazing, switching to a fluoride-free toothpaste, and avoiding cooking / drinking tap water. Locating a good source of water that you can trust is key, as even most bottled waters come from municipal, and therefore fluoridated, sources.

### Boost Your Productivity

Drinking the proper water at generous amounts allows the human body to run at it’s peak. This can increase energy levels, motivation, and result in a positive and uplifting mood.

Once you properly cut out overly-acidic drinks like soda, your body can get to work removing the toxins that would be typically ignored.

Staying active and having a good sweat at least once a day will keep you running smoothly. Combine this with cutting excessive consumption of dairy and meat products, which bog your intestinal tract for days and create an excess of mucus within your sinuses or other membranes.

Eating clean and drinking plenty of water will take you farther than any pharmaceutical ever could.

### Lowers Instances of Depression and Anxiety

Allowing your body to take a break from Caffeine and other substances (such as foods processed with chemicals) can have a positive impact on your mental health.

The brain, like any other organ in your body, needs to stay hydrated in order to perform optimally.

Combine this with minimal chemical ingestion by all methods and your body will have an opportunity to flush out any unwanted or unusable toxins.

### Increase Health Through Additional Methods

Take the time to find natural remedies or methods that can replace “standardized” products made by companies.

One area of importance is with Deodorant, of course, no one wants to smell of body odor, but that doesn’t mean you should be rubbing your underarms with a daily dose of Aluminum.

Your underarms are where your sympathetic and parasympathetic systems meet to create your [Autonomic nervous system](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Autonomic_nervous_system). This regulates most of the functions within your body, including:

-   **_Heart Frequency_**
-   **_Heart Capacity_**
-   **_Lumbar Function_**
-   **_Kidneys_**
-   **_Blood Vessels_**
-   **_Stomach and Intestines_**
-   **_And many other systems within the body._**
Don’t take this information lightly, if aluminum has already been discovered as destructive to the brain, imagine what it could do to other systems in your body not yet thoroughly researched. Staying vigilant in all chemicals that you subject yourself to can have a dramatic impact on your life – for the better. Switching to natural alternatives like Rock Salt can still prevent you from sweating, while limiting the amount of heavy metals that get into your body.

### Be Happy And Healthy

Maintaining health begins with the mindset, and ultimately comes down to the habits that you set forth in your daily life. Drinking lots of good water, eating leafy vegetables and fruits, regular exercise, gratitude, and keeping a positive outlook on life all have wonderful impacts for your health. If you find yourself in a slump mentally, be sure that it’s not because of the stuff you put into your body.

Use this information to make a positive change in your life and the world around you.
