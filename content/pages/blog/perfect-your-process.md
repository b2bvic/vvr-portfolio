Perfect Your Process

Yesterday, I spent my time creating a system that would bridge the boundaries between media production, digital content creation, search engine optimization / marketing, automation & distribution, business operations, and instruction.

It took more than a few hours but when I was finally done with my brainstorm, I had done it.

Why is this important? Because it‚Äôs a puzzle that I've been working on since I got into this profession, I just hadn‚Äôt realized it.

See, some people will look at the list I‚Äôve put before you and say that I‚Äôm ‚Äúoffering too much‚Äù or becoming a ‚Äúone-stop shop.‚Äù

The thing is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all the same system.

Literally. I‚Äôve created one method, for numerous outcomes, which is applicable to take on any niche, offering, business model, or product.

I have two case studies:

-   Cobra - Manufacturing Company


-   I created their entire Marketing Department

-   Systematized every procedure, method

-   Taught my replacement, and was fired

-   They are still using my methods to this day


-   The Way World Outreach - Non-profit Megachurch


-   Created Livestream Director Position

-   Systematized every procedure, method

-   Wrote a technical manual of operation

-   Revived a dead YouTube channel from 7k subs in 7 years, to 21k within a year

-   10 months since I‚Äôve left are now at 30k

-   They are still using my methods to this day

Both of these examples transcend Marketing, I was involved in Media Production, Videography, Photography, eCommerce (AWS), Email Marketing, Corporate Marketing Development, Live + Written Instruction, Mentorship, and so much more.

But it‚Äôs all the SAME. SYSTEM.

What happens when you get Version 1 of a system is you can immediately begin the iterative improvement process, and get to Version 1.1‚Ä¶ and so on.¬†

You don‚Äôt need to execute perfectly, you just have to solve the problem at a rate that matches, compounds, or exponentiates your efforts.

The level of which is dependent upon how ‚Äòsolved‚Äô your puzzle is. For the following examples, I‚Äôm going to use the puzzle of ‚Äòearning money.‚Äô

Level 1: It matches your effort. Ex - Finding a good job with good benefits and good hours, not too far from home, something they can support themselves. This is a 1:1. This is average life for most Americans, many are forever working toward this goal.

Level 2: It compounds your effort. Ex. - Balancing numerous income streams that makes you multiple returns in exchange for your attention. This can vary from like 2-7:1. People who usually move beyond 2 streams of income begin developing systems, delegating tasks, and freeing up their time to create new income while maintaining previous income.¬†

Level 3: It exponentiates your effort. Ex. - Models that not only produce systems & replicate a result, but document, distribute, instruct, maintain, and grow as a business does. These are where we see the most market-disrupting ideas take off. Ideas that force the change of adjacent industries or risk being left behind.

If on a scale from 2 - 3, I‚Äôm right around 2.3, last night I cracked 2.4, this morning I cracked 2.5, and only 15 minutes ago, I‚Äôve not only verified that such a solution is possible, I‚Äôve checked my work against an International Competitor in my local market.

It was nearly identical.

I found a video of theirs from a year ago, this was a company that pulled an entire ‚Äòpivot‚Äô on their business model within the last 12 months.

And I‚Äôm hot on their ass.

Perfect. Progress.¬†
