_Every single person alive and dead has interacted with systems from the moment of conception to their final breath on Earth. Let’s discover how they can be applied to your own life._

First of all, what is a System?

A **system**, simply put is: **_a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network._**
By this definition, there are several **systems** you interact with beginning at birth:

-   Your **family**
-   Your **community**
-   Your **religion**
-   Your **municipality**
-   Your **state**
-   Your **country**
These are all examples of **systems**.

But there are **_smaller_** systems you interact with every day:

-   Your **car**
-   Your **grocery store**
-   Your **computer**
-   Your **smartphone**
-   Your **place of work**
These too, are all **systems**.

Let’s take a look at the **etymology** of the word ‘**system**’:

1610s, “**the whole creation, the universe**,” from Late Latin **systema**
“**an arrangement, system**,” from Greek **systema**
“**organized whole, a whole compounded of parts**,” from stem of **synistanai**
“**to place together, organize, form in order**,” from **syn-** “**together**” (see syn-) + root of **histanai** “**cause to stand**,”

from PIE root ***sta-** “**to stand, make or be firm**.”

Now that we’ve got an understanding of what a system looks like, how can this be applied to you as an individual?

**_How do you go about applying systems-thinking into your day-to-day decision-making?_**
Let’s cover the basics…

A Skillful Approach to Disassociation

First of all, systems are nothing more than rules.

They aren’t just restrictions though.

They are pathways in which you can receive a specific output from a specific input, creating a specific result, repeatedly, reliably forever.

`**Input : Output = Results**`

Care for an example?

**_You encounter a stressful situation at your job. Let’s say you work in a sales department, talking over the phone._**
An application of systems-thinking in this circumstance would be:

**_Take a deep breath before reacting to a tense situation._**
-   **Tense Situation** is the **input**
-   **Breathing** is the **output**
-   **Response** is the **result**
**_Systems thinking is a diagnostic tool that can help you assess problems before taking action._**
**Zoom out.** Look at it from **the big picture.**
**To use the earlier example:**
-   Is the person speaking to you **going through something?**
-   Did they have a **particularly rough day?**
-   Have they been **unloaded on by higher-ups?**
-   Is there any indication that this **situation is about you specifically?**
-   Or a byproduct of **circumstances unrelated to you?**
Learning when to not take things personally: is a system by which you **remove your ‘feelings’** surrounding a situation in lieu of **deductive reasoning & calculated response.**
A strategy as simple as this could mean the difference between making a mistake that will later evolve into regret.

**To quote myself from several years ago, “The difference between _creativity_ and _reactivity_, lies all in how you C (See)”**
Remember this as you navigate through your world today.

Thank you for reading.
