Hello and welcome to Thor’s Day,

  

I’ve been writing a lot on Indoctrination, mainly because it’s the largest theme i’m dealing with in my own life.

  

There are patterns in which all of us are assigned to break in order to ‘proceed’ into a ~higher~ level of self.

  

I put those little symbols next to it because even though this is common terminology, I do not agree that there are ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ states of self.

  

There is just the embodiment of energy one chooses to emit at any given point in time.

  

A radio had a dial, with an ability to increase or decrease the frequency it tunes to; however, we do not differentiate between ‘lower’ stations (88.3 FM) from ‘higher’ ones (106.9 FM).

  

These are simply different ‘stations’ which a radio can tune to.

  

It’s my perspective that the brain operates in a similar fashion.

  

Although, I need to make this distinction clear:

  

There is NO part of my idiosyncratic (personal) experience that should be applied to your life.

  

I’m not here to wake you up.

  

I’m not even here to teach or set an example.

  

I’m writing this so the words don’t cloud my brain as I try to perform other functions throughout my life.

  

It’s an absolutely selfish reason.

  

But the clarity needs to be made before I continue so i’m not looked at as some sort of ‘role model’.

  

Each of you on this list is of the same caliber as me.

  

By that I mean, have the same ability to reach and fulfill your true potential.

  

If your first thought was an activity or goal, I want you to begin that work after reading.

  

If you had a thought and then justified it, then you know what the first objective is before starting such an activity.

  

There is no amount of me sharing my experience that will make you understand yours better.

  

I get people who come to me with problems, habits, or other issues in their life.

  

They want my opinion.

  

But I have none to offer.

  

No amount of my words will guide you through you experience better than what’s within you already.

  

All I can do is reflect.

  

I have no doubt in this ability of mine.

  

But it’s not something I profess or exclaim onto the world.

  

I no longer feel the need to ‘wake people up.’

  

Because i’m no better than someone who spoils the movie.

  

The best I can do is say, “Don’t miss this!”

  

And point.

  

But don’t look at my hand.

  

Look at the moon. Or the screen. Or whatever metaphor you’re comfortable with in representation to your holographic experience while on Earth.

  

Our realities have managed to bump shoulders.

  

For that, I may be the one that you 

  

That’s really all I have to say for today.

  

There is just one final request:

  

Go watch this youtube channel, you’ll innerstand the point: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QXwB89RDzA&t=3s
