_Systems-thinking is a mystery for most people because they don’t know where to begin, lets solve that today. Read on to learn how to most basic forms of systems are the easiest ones to implement._

The other day while on the phone with an old friend, he called me **pragmatic**.

I was sort of taken aback because the word hasn’t been used to describe me and isn’t one that I choose to ascribe to myself.

It does accurately describe a part of my outward personality, but it more accurately describes a quality about my systems in particular.

The definition is: _dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations._

So what’s the ONE secret to the best systems? It’s Pragmatism.

Pragmatism: The Framework for Systems

If you’ve read the [previous issue I posted](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/subtlebodhi/issues/systems-thinking-a-skillful-approach-to-disassociation-844092?utm_campaign=Methods%20%F0%9F%A4%9D%20Madness&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), you’ll know that a moment is all it takes to misread a situation.

In order to keep ourselves from doing that, we should practice a brief assessment of any situation **_outside of ourselves_** in that moment.

That’s what being a pragmatist is. You see the moment for what it is, rather than hypothesizing on what you think it _could_ be.

When you approach with a deductive mindset, you **eliminate** the **possibility** of **over-reading a situation**.

Emotions, or the ‘second’ voice in your head - as I call it, is the ‘reactionary’ part of your mind that will jump to the first conclusion that feels remotely satisfying or justified.

But before that voice speaks, the one that’s emotionally reacting, there’s a voice that’s describing reality for what it is.

Accepting Chaos as a Variable

Here’s the jagged pill: **life is going to happen to you.**

There’s **nothing you can do** to prevent this from happening to you.

You can make all the plans in the world, cover every variable in your mind prior to the situation or process, do whatever you feel is necessary to prepare you.

But you will never know **until the situation is actively unfolding**, which decisions make the most sense given:

1.  The amount of **time** you have.
2.  The amount of **context** you have.
3.  The amount of **pressure** you are under.

….in order to come to a **_decision_** _itself._

This is the most challenging part of systems, is knowing that they aren’t always going to work for every situation.

The **first** system is learning the **system.**

The **second** system is learning **when to use the system.**

Once chaos is approached from the mindset of “_there’s no way I could have predicted this, but I know the appropriate response._”

The best system is one that is **flexible enough to adjust to life’s chaos** while being **reliable enough to create repeatable results.**

This concept can be applied to any system…

-   Your **family**
-   Your **community**
-   Your **religion**
-   Your **municipality**
-   Your **state**
-   Your **country**
-   Your **automobile**
-   Your **grocery store**
-   Your **computer**
-   Your **smartphone**
-   Your **place of work**

Something to consider.

Thank you for reading.
