Last night I had the opportunity to speak with people much smarter than me during a dinner party.

Two major revelations came out of this conversation which I have allowed to simmer overnight and will explain for you, now.

1. Take yourself completely out of the equation

when it comes to building a business.

---

You might be asking yourself just exactly what the hell I'm talking about, but follow me here.

If you're a freelancer, entrepreneur, in your spare time or full time, there's a high level of probability that you're doing a lot of stuff yourself.

Handling customer service, packaging, shipping, order tracking, social media marketing, maintaining a web presence, developing & testing new product ideas... the list sort of goes on forever.¬†

"It's all me me me, I built this company, only I can do this, I run this show by myself!"

I leaned in to let him know I focusing his words at this table. Mainly because I had heard similar words only a week ago from another business mentor.¬†

"As a Founder, YOU are the bottleneck."

Again, I sat there astonished. But only for a moment.¬†

I've been working at accurately describing the skills that I have, the processes I have run, and the effects that I have on a business.

The last email talked about "[Systems All The Way Down](https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=1c8d9ae2eee9f8610d9a21713&id=96da17c6c3)," where I outlined the process of which, you create systems for all your tasks as though someone else were to perform them in your place.

Why do I know how to do this? Is it because I have a skill in instruction?

Not really, although being able to communicate why you want someone to do something is usually the motivation they need to actually perform the action.¬†

I've worked myself out of jobs because I have a skill for creating processes that save time, I have reasoning behind my methods, and I'm able to communicate them in such a way that is not overload on the intended operator.

The first time this happened, I didn't know it could be monetized. The second time it happened, it was to intentionally replace myself as I was leaving the organization.¬†

Enough about this point, what's the second thing I learned?

2. Your 10 Year Plan...

make it 3 Years.

---

  

AGAIN - this guy just shattered my reality because [I only decided my 10 Year Plan like 6 damn days ago](https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=1c8d9ae2eee9f8610d9a21713&id=abd1c449ed).¬†

  

What's the reasoning? Well, a smart business owner knows that the markets are going to be different in 3 years time.

  

10 years is FAR too much of a commitment for anyone with business savvy to logically conclude is a good idea.

  

That changed nothing of my plans. I'm not going to budge. I've set my mind.

  

3 years it is.¬†

  

So, let's wrap this up:

  

Take yourself out of the equation, plan out the next 10 years, then do it in 3.

  

Cool? Cool.

  
  

To Perfect Progress,¬†
