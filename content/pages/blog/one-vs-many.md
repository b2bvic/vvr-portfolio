Hello,

It‚Äôs friday night.

I turned down going to the drive-in because there‚Äôs been a certain weight over my head regarding my next move for this personal brand.

(This is gonna be a marketing email, hold onto your hats)

I‚Äôll try to keep it interesting.

Today, I received some really great guidance from an independent marketer (completely by his own choice - i didn‚Äôt pay him), all I did was include him in a FF tweet. (I‚Äôm old school, ten years on twitter does that to people.)

He doesn‚Äôt follow me, but i‚Äôve tried to build a rapport by chiming in when I can.

So anyway, there were a few great suggestions that he had for me.

But there was one criticism that I knew was coming:

I was trying to be all things to all people.

That may not sound like much of an issue for some, but for anyone who makes money online, they will tell you the same thing.

It‚Äôs about mastery of ONE product, service, or skill.

You wouldn‚Äôt go to a surgeon who spent his off time cobbling shoes.

That would not only be a waste of his expertise, but would likely bring down the level of credibility within his primary profession.

Now, first and foremost: I‚Äôm a creative person.

But my favorite medium, although I play music, beatbox, teach, build websites.‚Ä¶ all this other stuff,

Is writing.

I‚Äôve been writing my entire life.

It was how I began my start within marketing 5 years ago, writing for shitty websites about ‚ÄúCell Phone Trackers‚Äù or for weed blogs.

It was truly the start to a practice that i‚Äôm now, REALLY good at.

I mean, I‚Äôm typing this right now at a solid 70 wpm, without typos (generally) and without looking down at the keyboard.

But more than that, I can create a story.

Not just limited to my experience or expertise, either.

I can comsume complex information and break it down into small, bite-sized pieces and explanations that the simplest layman can enjoy and understand.

I write for a multi-million dollar company every day.

The skill that I have at my disposal is being wasted because I‚Äôm not focused on the one skill i‚Äôm perhaps best at (at this moment.)

How fucking foolish of me.

So tonight, I‚Äôll be studying up on optimizing my website: the copy, services, and SEO.

Because I know there are companies out there that will pay top dollar for a person who not only knows what they‚Äôre doing, but can deliver results.

I will focus on writing.

And that means writing to you, too.

So if you enjoy the stories I share, the knowledge I hold, the value I bring to your inbox:

Spread the word, let me know, either by responding to these emails or giving me a quick shout out on twitter.

As a bonus, allow me to include the commencement speech I wrote at 18, as I finished the charter school that was the surrogate for the high school I was kicked out of.

You‚Äôll likely notice some similarities.

Until tomorrow.

Love ya.

Victor.
