_Your environment has served as a system for your brain to release cognitive stress or memories since you were a wee little human. Let’s discover how your environment is a system that can pre-determine outcomes in your life._

An excerpt from [NOBA Project](https://nobaproject.com/modules/memory-encoding-storage-retrieval?utm_campaign=Methods%20%F0%9F%A4%9D%20Madness&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) outlines the idea of ‘Encoding’ Memories from your environment.

**Encoding refers to the initial experience of perceiving and learning information. When you walk across campus, for example, you encounter countless sights and sounds—friends passing by, people playing Frisbee, music in the air. The physical and mental environments are much too rich for you to encode all the happenings around you or the internal thoughts you have in response to them. So, an important first principle of encoding is that it is selective: we attend to some events in our environment and we ignore others. A second point about encoding is that it is prolific; we are always encoding the events of our lives—attending to the world, trying to understand it.**
**_So what’s that mean?_**
The brain is up to the task, but it’s impossible for it to record everything. So it takes the most important stuff and record that instead.

Whether positive or negative, we can think of these occurrences as forms of ‘trauma’.

**Positive trauma** is the fear of a roller coaster, the thrill of the ride, the relief as it slowed, and the recollection of your nerves as you exit.

**Negative trauma** is the noise within a typical household, it can be the space you have to share with siblings or family, it was the schools you went to (even otherwise of what you were taught, specifically).

Nature vs. Nurture: which is it?

The process of growing older **requires you to become accustomed to your environment,** one way or another.

`_This can mean that you got good at_ **_fights_** _because of school._`

`_This can mean that you got good at_ **_study_** _because of school._`

`_It could mean anything that has ever happened to you, eve_`

Your body, and therefore your mind, will do whatever is necessary to encode the correct information to be readily accepted when the time comes.

But there is a level of control that you can exert over yourself, and your environment_—circumstances allowing._

Mitigating Your Circumstances

If you’re someone who’s living in a multi-generation household, chances are there are times where the noise in the house is a lot just from everyday activities. This isn’t to say it’s a bad thing, but it can be distracting for consistent cacophony to be an earful.

What are the steps that you can take to mitigate something like this? Headphones that block out the noise is a good option. Going to a coffee shop to get your work done may be an alternative.

Point of the matter is, there are levels of ‘solutions’ that can be applied to anything you encounter within your life. It’s up to you to apply the creativity of a solution that’s being asked of you.

There’s levels to life, it’s impossible to outline all of the variables on one newsletter.

But we’ll keep chopping at this tree until there’s nothing left of it.

Thank you for reading.
