**Lessons from the Fall Advance

As you may or may not be aware, I left my home state of California to go live in North Carolina, a move which was made over a two month period, for a new Marketing Position.

The total amount of travel was about 8 days, with a total of about 5 days of rest / relaxation, and about 50 hours worth of travel


It has been the experience of a lifetime, so far, even though it didn't quite go according to plan, it was, single-handedly, the most rewarding risk ever taken.


Lessons from moving between California to North Carolina, a thread:

- Californians live in a 'scared little bitch' bubble
- Everyone drives insane everywhere
- Improvisation is a pinnacle skill
- Never be too sure, to ask for help, or to learn 
- Learn from all elders, maybe teach them, too
- No better first impression than a warm smile
- Leave no trace
- Accept your skills, find their place
- There is no excusing, excuses
- All the money in the world wont buy Honor
- Speak it into existence
- Breathe deeper 
- Document only in-between presence
- Respect the wishes of others
- Do not have an open mind without an open heart
- Manners go a long way
- Pay your dues, accept your dividends
- Stand in strength, sit in silence
- Detach from result; accept it
- Do hard things
