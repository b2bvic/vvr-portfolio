I know, it's a different format now, I got tired of looking at the other one and I don't care enough to design something else so I'm just writing.

Over my life I have collected a number of skills that most people consider unnecessary.

So, in order to explain exactly how I came to be this way, I'm just going to spend the next few minutes recollecting over my life and the circumstances / choices that led to me being a multi-faceted person.

The earliest I can remember, I was extroverted, would speak to adults as though they were my equals, and never shy away from a new environment.

From the age of about 5, I had been home-schooled by my mother in reading and mathematics, I was already at a 6th grade level when I began Kindergarten. Sometimes, going to school early to tutor the 3rd graders during their reading time.

Around that same age, I had remarkable academic performance, and would regularly be called on to address either my fellow classmates, or the school as a whole.

I remember relishing in the attention this would earn me and continually craved more.

During this same period of my life, my mom was still with my dad, and even though we were extremely poor, he was wildly inventive in the ways we could have fun.

My Dad's Dad was a photographer / videographer, this led to my Dad's own interest in owning a camcorder, because there are so many tapes that my Grandfather had, and I know his intention was to leave a visual legacy for my sister and I as we got older.¬†

So, to put this all in reference, by the age of 7, I was:

-   Extremely outgoing socially

-   Was a Public Speaker

-   Adjusted to being On-Camera

You can sort of see how these skills would come into play later, but let's continue.

At this point, my life sort of took a major chance as my parents divorced each other, leaving my sister and I under full custody of my mom, and giving my dad to opportunity to fuck off for months at a time while he partied and generally didn't keep his shit together.

It was at that point that school no longer worked for me, teachers had become accustomed to my 'know-it-all' attitude and I frequently felt restricted, there was just no challenge to school.

I became a troublemaker and completely checked out of public schooling by the time I reached 5th grade.

Around the time of 6th / 7th grade, my dad was around more often, specifically, he became a DJ. (He was like 27-28 at this time - not much older than I am now, so I get it.)

Things really began changing for me at that point. I was handed a mix CD from Dad of Beatboxing.¬†

For reference, my dad grew up as a B-Boy and Tagger, he was well acquainted with Hip-Hop and so he found an outlet for me to explore.

This CD single-handedly changed my life.¬†

I began studying beatboxing religiously, imitating all the routines and sounds I could listen to, and within a year I was pretty damn good. Good enough to the point that I was holding performances at the middle school I attended. Laying beats for people who can freestyle. Coming up with my own routines, allat.

There‚Äôs another layer to this, 7th grade I began newcasting during the morning announcements at my school. I was one of the few children who could read in a naturally-speaking voice, I was often the ‚Äòlead‚Äô and did it pretty much daily. This solidified my ability in front of the camera further, as well as becoming familiar with framing, lighting, and basic direction.

Let's move on a few more years, I'm 13 now, in 8th grade. I had spent a lot of time volunteering with a group of teachers that taught music from the perspective of Indigenous Tribes, this was the actual name of the program. They focused on simple percussion techniques and didgeridoo playing.¬†

I did a little bit of everything but I was mainly there to beatbox.

There was a performance I was invited to at the High School that I would attend the following year, naturally I accepted. I put on an awesome 10 minute set, pulling off the (now infamous) 'If Your Mother Only Knew' routine by Rahzel, the first to combine lyrical vocals and simultaneously beatboxing.

Long story short, I was approached by the band instructor in order to (maybe) beatbox for th emarching Band (it was a stupid idea, and obviously not what would happen, but I was young and naive).¬†

Freshman year comes around and I walk into the band room like, "I'm here."¬†

The teacher was surprised, and since didn't really have anything for me to 'do' while I was there, offered that I should learn an instrument. I mean, I was already interested, so what did I have to lose?

I chose Trombone. It was similar to the Broken-Bass Technique I was already familiar with by beatboxing for so long.

I learned trombone within 3 months, was Section Leader for the Trombones within 6 months.

I learned Baritone, Euphonium, Tuba, and Trumpet the following year, at 15.

At 16, I started teaching myself Piano, Mallet Percussion, and Drumline.

At 17, I was a multi-instrumentalist, the Low Brass Section Leader of the Band, and in the Marching, Advanced, Beginning (Instruction), and Jazz bands.

I was primed to be the next Drum Major for the band my senior year.

All the while, I was still excelling in English, which was the only subject that I cared to show effort in. Railing through the Advanced Placement / International Baccalaureate classes. Often sleeping through lessons and timed writings to provide more of a ‚Äòchallenge.‚Äô

I‚Äôd also taken this newfound skill as an opportunity to perform within a local Ska Band. I was only 16 and better than most adults who play within those bands.

Then everything changed, when I decided to lead a crime-syndicate with my band friends.

That‚Äôs a story for another time, all you need to know is that I got kicked out of school my Junior Year.

During this time, I fell into my first real depression, and began composing music. Being stuck at home, bored, and missing your friends was the new norm, it was challenging to adjust.

[I wrote a really sad song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OL322QfGKI) as a gift to my then girlfriend, as I had basically lied (& shielded) these activities from her complete awareness. Go ahead and check it out, I wrote everything except for the Trumpet Solo. Which was written by my late brother Saul, who was a master in more ways than myself.

So, to recap:

1.  Extremely outgoing socially (5)

2.  Was a Public Speaker (6)

3.  Adjusted to being On-Camera (7)

4.  Started Beatboxing (10)

5.  Started Hosting on Camera (12)

6.  Started Live Perfomances (12)

7.  Learned Trombone (13)

8.  Learned Baritone, Euphonium, Tuba, and Trumpet (14 - 15)

9.  Self-Taught Piano, learned Mallet Percussion, & Drumline (16)

10.  ¬†Performed Ska / Reggae / Punk Locally (16)

11.  Wrote My First Composition (17)

12.  Professional Studio Feature (20)

Most of these skills happened because of the one previous to it. They‚Äôre all sort of circling the same industry.¬†

It goes further as I get older.

I got accepted to a program at the local community college, while still in continuation school, to have an opportunity to take college classes while finishing my diploma.

I graduated from the program (High School), on time, with Recognition, and was a Commencement Speaker for the event.

Further cementing not only my speaking ability, but my writing ability as well. I made one of the teachers cry with a surprise shout-out, it was a whole thing.

Anyway, I further my musical career while at RCC, playing with the Wind Ensemble, and Piano Ensemble concurrently. This is not typically done, students usually have to pick one instrument as their primary.

I was doing two as a music major, taking 8-10 units of music while also taking upwards of 8-10 units for the general education classes, of which, I was yet again accepted into the Honors Program.

Life sort of shifted for me when I left the house at 19. I began working Pizza Hut as a Delivery Driver and learning SEO Website Content Writing with my (then) Mentor.

By day I was a digital slave, by night i was a pizza guy.

It wasn‚Äôt the life I wanted, but I knew I wanted to be involved with Digital Marketing, and I knew my writing would get me there.

Let‚Äôs see if I can rapid fire the next few years and spare a few details:

-   16, Telemarketing, Product Specialist

-   17, Criminal, Performing Musician

-   19, Pizza Hut, while learning SEO

-   20, Warehouses, Forklift Operator, Freelance Content Writing

-   21, Warehouses, Machine Operator, Volunteer Social Media Gig

-   22, Marketing Coordinator, Child Piano Instruction

-   23, Marketing Supervisor, Adult Piano Instruction

-   24, Live Production + Director, Freelance Marketing

-   25, Content / Copy Specialist, Freelance Marketing

Most people told me that I‚Äôd never get a job writing for websites, [then I started doing that](https://retronuke.com/author/victor-romo/), then they told me I would never get a job doing social media, [then I started doing that](https://twitter.com/cobracarbide?lang=en), not many people understood why I worked for a church, but upped their content / media production to gain them 10,000+ subscribers within a few months, then people were skeptical that I had actually received a job offer because of people I know from twitter.¬†

Fact of the matter is, I‚Äôm skilled at being talented, and talented with my application of skill.

-   Music Instruction

-   Production

-   Live / Recorded Performance

-   Direction

-   Hosting

-   Website Concepts

-   Content / Ghost¬† / Copywriting / Editing

-   Email Marketing

-   Social Media Marketing

-   Basic Design

-   Corporate Development

-   Amazon eCommerce

-   Digital Advertisements

That‚Äôs really just scratching the surface. But I hope you understand the scope at which I operate, and why it‚Äôs been such a challenge for me to ‚Äòfocus up‚Äô on one specific niche.

Fact of the matter is, I don‚Äôt have a niche.

And I‚Äôm living my life now to that effect.

I‚Äôm here to be ‚Äúpretty good‚Äù at everything.

Because I‚Äôm even better at fitting those pieces together. Given the new group of people I have surrounded myself with, I see great changes coming.

On a level that currently rivals the paradigm we‚Äôve been chained by since the banks took over the world.

Just you wait and see, and if you can‚Äôt now, don‚Äôt worry.

I‚Äôll always loan my vision.

Thank you for reading,

Your friend,

Victor V
