My (Ex)periences

Speaking with exes is often spoken upon negatively within the circles that i'm a part of online.

Personally, if you avoid speaking to your ex, you're a fucking coward.

I'm going to explain why, don't worry.

Granted, right off the bat there are some relationships which don't really qualify for this.

But if you've spent a number of years with a person, just to throw it all away and start over with someone new, it's not very likely that you'll learn the reasons that broke you two up in the first place.

I'm speaking from personal experience, as I just got off a 4 hour video chat with my high-school sweetheart, we'd been together for nearly 4 years, and after I ended things there was a few more years of buffer before I even felt ready to handle a task like this.

Now, in my case, I jumped to a new (relation)ship nearly immediately following this one.

This is not something that I advise anyone do, without time for self-reflection, you're setting yourself up for another failure.

It happened for me like this, I had work backwards in the order of relationships, in order to grow with sufficiency.

Reverse-engineering your personal patterns and shortcomings like this allows you to recollect the motivations of your actions, and tie them back to earlier and earlier experiences.

If done properly, you get to the point beyond relationships and move into the two most important relationships that are overlooked:

-   Parental Relationships

-   Personal Relationship

If you've read any of my past writing, you know the level of importance I hold the initial interactions you learn from observing and mimicking your parents.

This action created a feeling of love from them, for you.

We then go out into the world, hoping that these same methods and strategies will work.

They don't.

So, what's this have to do with speaking and learning from those you've had relations with in the past?

Well, you may come to find that some of them likely went through a similar experience with the next partner(s) as you had with them.

I find that people tend to attract the inverse of the personality they were with prior, in order to experience the 'other side of it all.'

At least, this is true in my case.

The person I spent 4 years blaming and holding animosity to (due to my own lack of self-awareness and analysis), ended up creating the same animosity with her next partner, but inverted.

So, all in all, it's a trip.

Because we choose our mirrors for a reason.

And if you've spent longer than 18 months with someone, chances are you know them better than they know themselves.

Relationships are the prime opportunity to tell someone what they need to fix, while ignoring ourselves.

Set your pride aside, and try to reconnect with some of these people if you're thinking about them right now.

It doesn't have to be romantically, and honestly, it shouldn't.

But opening up that channel of communication can be very rewarding if you're ready to handle the responsibility of your actions.

Let the water run under the bridge.

Then, if you're both willing...

jump into the river together.

There's so much of you left to be discovered.

A previous relationship can be used as a vantage point for how far you've come,

and how far you have left to go.

You really never know, you might even get along in a new friendship.

Don't squander the energy and attention you've put into others, once you've invested in yourself.

You and I both know that they still live in your heart.

Don't ignore your tenants.

.

You are strong,

You are free,

You are loved,

Thank you for reading,

Your friend allways,

Victor V.
