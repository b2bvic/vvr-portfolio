Yesterday, I made it a point to write out the goals that I have for myself over the next 10 years.¬†

  

Reason being is when I think back on myself 10 years ago, while I was a teenager in high school, I really could not have foreseen the routes that I would take to end up where I am now.

  

This is a mistake made by my teenage self, but hey, even though he really wanted to be a professional musician (and for a while, I was), it just didn‚Äôt hold my interest in the same ways it did with my more dedicated friends.

  

Back in 2010 I had complete intentions to continue studying trombone and piano, going to a technical school to learn how to repair instruments, and opening up a music store with 3 of my friends.

  

Life had other plans for us, I became increasingly disinterested in following this path.

  

My entire adult life, or rather career, has been focused on writing for the sake of marketing. When I was 19, I was picked up to write about content that has relevance to making money on the internet. However, I wasn‚Äôt a copywriter, I was a content writer.

  

My focus was to simply fill up a few pages of writing and include a phrase or keyword that would enable the page to rank, and advertisements were driving the revenue.

  

I didn‚Äôt really have a plan, but I was good at writing so I stuck with it.

  

Eventually I became a Content Creator for social media, which honestly, is the worst work in the world and I absolutely loathe it.

  

Finally, the last 4 years have had a special focus on Professional Level marketing, between creating an entire Marketing Department for a manufacturing corporation, to building the media suite which resurrected mega-church‚Äôs dead youtube channel into one that‚Äôs still growing, it was an eventful few years.

  

Which leads me to where I am currently and the road ahead‚Ä¶

  

I posted a few tweets yesterday regarding SMART Goals, i‚Äôll paste them below:

  

-   Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
    
-   Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
    
-   Achievable (agreed, attainable).
    
-   Relevant (reasonable, realistic, resourced, results-based).
    
-   Time bound (time-based, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).
    

  

Got one? Good.

  

Select the appropriate 'time-frame' for said goal, and work backwards

  

-   10 years
    
-   5 years
    
-   2.5 years
    
-   1 year
    
-   Quarterly
    
-   Monthly
    
-   Weekly
    
-   Daily
    

  

Don't have one for 10 years from now? Dream bigger.

  

Now‚Ä¶. for the goals I‚Äôm to accomplish by 36‚Ä¶

  

-   Self
    

-   Nomad
    
-   Acrobat-Level Physique
    
-   Own 3 Properties (Home, Rental, Homestead)
    

-   Career
    

-   7 Figures
    
-   Digital ________ Platform
    
-   Marketing ________ Platform
    

-   Expression
    

-   Compose a Symphony
    
-   Write an Autobiographical Self-Analysis
    

-   Family
    

-   Household
    
-   2 - 4 Children
    
-   Life Curriculum (Hackschooling)
    

  

It‚Äôs a rather short list, but I know they‚Äôre large enough to require a decade‚Äôs worth of continued work. Do I assume that I will be able to accomplish all of these? No.

  

But that‚Äôs not going to stop me from keeping them at the top of mind.

  

You may notice a few words are missing from this list, it‚Äôs intentional, not that I think you‚Äôll steal my ideas (or execute them better than me) but they‚Äôre going to be their own writing later.

  

The point of all this is to say, if your intuition is good, you may get lucky and lead yourself onto a path that is fruitful in the long run.

  

However, even if this is the case, you should be aware of keeping some sort of trained perspective on the horizon for your goals.

  

Take some time today and think about what this means for your life.

  
  

To Perfect Progress,

  

‚ÄîVictor Valentine
