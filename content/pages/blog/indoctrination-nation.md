date:: tags:: #👁 ** Let’s discuss an idea I feel is the largest detriment to humanity: Indoctrination Let’s pull the definition of Indoctrination: 1 : to instruct especially in fundamentals or rudiments : teach 2 : to imbue with a usually partisan or sectarian opinion, point of view, or principle To blow the lid on this concept, I will tell a story. It’s a story most people have experienced already, we call it ‘life.’ ## Birth: The Early Years You’re born.

Immediately, your parents choose a name for you and stamp your sole (soul) on a birth (berth) certificate. This assures the United States Government and the financial powers that you will be a productive member of society.’ You’ve just inherited your portion of the national debt. This is a loosely attributed form of Indoctrination, or rather, [Conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription).

You’re born into this country so immediately you must pay to be here. Alright, moving on…. The first 5 years of your life are spent in curious wonder and pure immersion within this reality being discovered. But, not if your parents have something to say about it. Usually, they indoctrinate you into their belief systems. Whether Judeo-Christian, Islamic, or otherwise. I’m willing to bet that 95% of you had to endure going to church (of some kind) to worship a deity.

Most people never try and experiment with other modes of thought, belief, or study of ‘sacred’ text. And that’s the entire point. So, you’re 5 years old, probably believe that you will go to Hell if you’re not a good little boy / girl. ## Do Not Pass Go: Go Straight to Child Jail What comes next? Kindergarten and public schooling. (Unless you’re privileged, but even then, you’re still getting some type of schooling).

Now, here’s the play with this whole ‘public school’ thing. It’s the same exact process that happens to adults due to the Government. Again, we spend the first 5 years of our life learning how to talk, asking about our surroundings, learning about the world, just to be told to sit down, be still, shut up, and follow a specific set of directions in order to be deemed a person worth talking to. School is an indoctrination process, turning a creative and expressive young mind into an automaton.

Bell rings, line up, follow directions, don’t talk. Follow the conveyor line in order to be fed. Scarf your food fast and you may have time to play. This was called Recess at some point, not sure how many schools still allow it. But why is it called that? Is it because there is a recession of the programming that was taking place beforehand? Is it because the designers of the schooling system (side note: public school was created to stall children from entering the job market, so a process was developed that prepared them for line on an assembly line; hence all of the similarities to a manufacturing process) KNEW that children would need small breaks?

As each year passes, the idea of self-expressive thought becomes more and more restricted. Soon enough, by the time you hit 10 or 11, you’re no longer even allowed to play outside. Instead, it becomes Physical Education. So now, they’re making play time, into work. Because that’s the mindset they need you in: work-mode. Meeting deadlines, following requirements, not asking questions, not optimizing processes.

Just. Doing. The. Work. Let’s fast forward a little bit. ## Onto Adulthood AKA ‘Adulting’ Now we’re 17. The last 6 years were spent learning a block schedule, being responsible for making it to class across campus, and generally increasing the amount of work one needs to do in order to ‘make the grade.’ Graduation is right around the corner. But, due to the constant barrage of programming, you believe the next step is College.

Rather than following the interests you have (if any are left by now) and getting some related experience. Now, here’s the question I pose for you: why, after 13 years of programming, would you be willing to forego 4 years of your life, continuing the same exact process you just completed? Here’s the answer: the indoctrination worked. So instead of getting fed and taught for years on the Government’s dime, YOU get to pay for it.

(Unless you’re REALLY good at this process, then they’ll pay for you.) Except now you get to drink on campus and fuck your classmates. Cool. Public school conveniently leaves out the concepts that would serve you most within this society: - Inflation - How to make money - Teaching yourself concepts - Becoming a leader of self You’re left with this hodge-podge of a personality, cultivated by proximity of other caged humans, and call it ‘you’.

You’ve long since forgotten the curiosities and sense of discovery once held in that precious tiny human brain as a child. College is a fleecing of the grooming process that took 13 years to accomplish. And so many people fall for it. ## Debt Discharged to Debit Cards The meta-deception, is that you’re paying for this debt, with other debt (promissory notes) we call Dollars or Federal Reserve Notes.

Let’s look at the facts: - College is more expensive now that it ever has been (rising faster than even Inflation) - You pay for all materials - The teachers (usually) cannot get fired - There is a horrible over-saturation of Bachelor’s degrees — causing people to work jobs that aren’t in their field of study — or deciding to dive further into debt for a Master’s or a Doctorate. - The Return on Investment (your time + money) will take another two decades to repay Overall, it’s looking like a raw deal.

We were sold dreams. I was, too. I went through 2 years of Junior College (High School 2.0) before realizing it wasn’t for me. Don’t get it twisted, if you know how to network, your net worth will likely be okay. But for the majority of introverted, self-doubt-filled, non-leading student body. They are up shit’s creek without a paddle. And turn to the next system which will ‘take care of them’. Socialism and Government.

Isn’t it amazing? The powers to be managed to spend 16 years of your life spinning you in circles, never admitting their system, just for you to co-op the only system that benefits them, completely, again. School is useful, when used properly. But for the majority, it’s nothing more than a “you-pay” internship-babysitting service. The adults coming out of school have an imaginary ideal of how the world works.

And it’s terrifying. Not terrific. So, my guidance for you, is to take learning into your own hands. Find the money. Find the markets. Learn how to play this game so well, you never have to play again. That’s the only way to win. But for now: never stop learning, self-teaching, experimenting, reading. There are online courses to teach anything. College is a dying industry. The Internet is still in its infancy.

Go find your slice. ## Self-Induced Hypnosis. Have you ever had an idea that swelled your being with possibility, with wonder? A thought pops into your head like, “I’ll never be able to do that.” “I don’t have that sort of talent.” “That’s just not a possibility.” This, my friends, is another form of crippling thought that puts limits on the creative fire within us that wants to burn the world (in love).

It stems from the same words that those external sources implanted within us over and over and over again. Over a great amount of time. I’ve dealt with it in my own life. Although a level of surety in my attempts, a little voice in my head exudes doubts whenever a new idea comes. This was particularly true when I started to get into marketing for myself. Before I ever worked as a desk-jockey, I was just a content writer for my roommate, who was a web designer.

Just getting the hang of internet marketing, he would often fill my head with lots of ideas for making money, starting my own websites, and generally trying to make a name for myself within this digital space. Tony, you’ll probably never read this, but i appreciate you immensely. However, I was only 19 when I started copywriting for him. The internal voice of self-doubt and limitation was much louder.

Same call it ‘Ego’, I call it, the ‘Fuck You’ voice. He’s much quieter now, but during my youth, and especially during my psychedelic trips, he makes his presence known. And while I was 19, his presence was so well-known I often mistook it for the voice that leads me into new territory, new adventures, new experiments. The trick is to become aware of when one voice is speaking toward your growth. And when another is speaking toward your limitation.

We all build our own mental prisons, this is something you cannot refute, and if you attempt to, the mirror within me will reflect that back at you. This is one of the reasons I say that interaction with me changes people. Because i’ve torn much of my mental limitation down. I pursue the next fear, always. Reason being is, if we’re not afraid of the next possibility, have we grown to the point of releasing the ones we currently entertain?

My guess would be no. The internal tool for this mental prison, put simply: is Shame. Shame is a crippling method of breaking a person down. Our parents use it. Our religious institutions use it. Our governments use it. Why? Because it works. How dare you go against my word? After all I have done for you, the clothes on your back, the food in your mouth, all this I've done for you. This was something my parents would utilize on me until I got to the age of 7.

My response was succinct and cut them down to the core. I didn’t ask to be here. You do this because I’m your mistake. Insensitive? Yes. Wrong? No. God sacrificed his only Son to heal you of your sins, and this is how you repay him? If Jesus truly believed in his actions, would he not understand my reasoning for doubt? Would you dare question God’s perfect creation of my thought process? This was my response to church at around 12.

Soon enough I found myself becoming an ‘agnostic’ and turning to Science to explain the world around me. Foolish? Yes. Wrong? Not at the time. It was necessary. The government is here to protect us, to make sure that riots don’t happen on the streets. We have freedom in this country, do you not understand? A true definition of ‘rights’ and ‘freedom’ are self-evident, and shouldn’t require an authority figure in order for these concepts to hold weight.

This was me at around 18, when I became an Anarchist. Fact of the matter is, shame should not be co-opted by the entities who try to impose it onto you. Whether it be your parents, family, religion, or government. Do not allow your mind to be soft. Do not repeat their mantras. I stopped speaking the Pledge of Allegiance at 12. I still stood for the flag (which is bad enough) but I refused to utter those words that I learned when I was 5 years old.

The reason being, is that no child understands what those words mean. Yet, many people still refer to simple concepts like the Star Spangled Banner or the colors of our flag and tie that into what it means to be ‘free’. My friends, freedom means to have a choice of choosing the opposite of the status quo. This goes no different for the governing parts of your mind. There is a voice that analyzes the world around you due to the electrical synapses received from your senses.

There is another voice that creates a story around these reactions, we often call them ‘memories’. Then, there is one final voice which whispers softly. One of inspiration. One of hope. One of possibilities. This is the voice that needs the spotlight. Reality, no matter how it’s explained does not exist. 99.9999999% of atoms are empty space. We see < 1% of the Electromagnetic spectrum in the form of ‘Visible Light’.

Our recollection of memory is malleable. Our brains run at a 500ms lag behind what’s happening. Every time your eyes move to the following words on this screen, it’s cutting away the ‘blur’ that would happen from the sweep. Our brains try and convince us that THIS is the way to live. That THIS is the way we must think. That we are bound by that which does not serve us. Our habits. Our concepts and mis-conception.

Our patterns. Our subscription to those mental stories we associate with our possibilities, limitations, and capabilities. We are not our minds. We are not our limits. We are creation, embodied. Take a breath and appreciate the triple-entendre of that last sentence. This reality stems from our mind but also is the effect of it. Become comfortable with the paradox. Because once you have, You’ll see that this place is not so absolute.

Everything is malleable. All is an opportunity, in the creator’s mind. The next time you have a limiting thought pattern or voice of doubt. Breathe into it. Send love to it. That voice just wants some attention; wants action on its behalf. I used to believe I was borderline schizophrenic. But I know that it’s the product of a mind trapped within the open-air hamster cage that we call Civil-Lie-Say-Shun.

(Civilization) I get along with my demons. I exercise / exorcise them. Those voices are not me. But are remnants of a program i’m still defragmenting. I hope this serves you well. **
