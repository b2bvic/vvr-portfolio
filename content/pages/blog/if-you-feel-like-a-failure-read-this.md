_“Go back the way you came” is not often the guidance you want to hear. It implies a lot of things, namely: failure, distress, possibly even panic._

_But there’s a benefit to going back the way you came…_

The second pass carries more information that the first.

The reason I’m writing on this right now is because I recently made a change in my life that I would have considered a “back-track” just a few years ago.

I took a salaried SEO position.

I came to terms with the fact that I have a great set of skills, but I don’t have ALL skills. I don’t have EVERY skill.

Being a freelancer or agency owner (and a successful one at that) means you’re coming with everything you need to find the work AND get it done.

Years of scraping by showed me that there are just some areas of my life that are dissonant to my nature.

And that’s okay.

Let’s return over to the point, “go back the way you came.”

Stepping into a position within a company is something I haven’t done in about 5 years.

This time around: solely SEO within the entire company.

Whereas before I was struggling… now I have a new set of challenges, which really was the same challenge all along: **scale**.

Both situations are testing and have tested my skills. You’ve probably encountered something similar in your own life.

Where it gets tricky, and where most people fall short within themselves, is **treating the new situation as _something that is truly new_**.

After all, you’re you _NOW_, not the ‘you’ _THEN_.

Those prior experiences and influences go a long way in keeping a good head on your shoulders. 

In light of all this, I’ve done some reflection and learned something about myself.

I may greatly enjoy _building websites, photography, & automation_ but it’s not where my passion lies with this stuff.

I live for the **puzzle**.

I live for the **mystery**.

I live for the **discovery**.

Search Engine Optimization is the only digital marketing discipline I’ve found that scratches these itches for me.

So when you find the one that works for you - don’t be afraid to take a step back and explore adjacently.

Stay true to you.

Don’t lose your head **before** you lose your way.
