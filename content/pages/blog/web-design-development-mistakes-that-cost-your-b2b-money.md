# Web Design & Development Mistakes That Cost Your B2B Money

Websites are often considered a heavy investment for a business. They cost money to maintain, they cost money to write for, & they cost money to develop.

Developer, in particular, have a challenging job. They have to not only build the website, they have to find ways for it to integrate into a company's current tech stack.

That's a large ask.

When a developer is doing work on a website, they will often place it within a "Dev" Environment.

This is important because when changes are being made to a website, you don't want the 'in-progress' website to be indexed by Google or seen by potential customers.

But what happens when the website is ready to launch? Ready to be used by the world?

The Developer pushes "Publish" and all's good, right?

Not quite.

# When Traffic Goes Down, Money Goes Down
When a website has a slow, steady decline of organic traffic, it's often because that Google updates are not being kept up with in real time.

This looks something like how it does below:

That steep decline somewhere in the middle of 2020-2021 looks more like to be a Google algorithm fluctuation.

The cost of this traffic depends on the industry that you're within & the amount of money the CPC is to run Paid Advertisements to target the same keywords.

# Nofollow & Noindex Woes
It's a small, little checkbox that lets Google crawlers know not to follow a link on your website, and not to index it - respectively.

While this is something that developers remember to turn on at the beginning of their work - it's often the same button that's forgotten when the work is completed.

You can imagine the implications for organic search. (It's not good.)

As an SEO, this is often the first question that I ask. "Was there any new work recently done to the website?"

That little checkbox can do a lot of damage if it isn't remembered.

# Web Design & Development Errors Impacting B2B Finances

Investing in a high-quality website entails a considerable expenditure of time, effort, and capital. Developers bear significant responsibility, as they must not only create the site, but also guarantee compatibility with a business's existing technology landscape.

Operating in a "Dev" environment during development shields a website from premature indexing by Google or accidental discovery by potential customers. Despite these precautions, certain factors must be taken into account upon website completion, as they can negatively affect online visibility and lead to reduced organic traffic.

# Consequences of Decreased Organic Traffic
A reduction in a website’s organic traffic can result from factors such as overlooked Google updates or unseen algorithm shifts. This decline can prompt businesses to spend more for targeted paid advertising campaigns.

# Evading Nofollow and Noindex Shortcomings
Throughout development, nofollow and noindex tags are often applied to prevent Google from crawling or indexing the site’s links. Leaving these settings unchanged after completion can lower search visibility and lead to lost revenue opportunities.

# Remedying Common Web Development Missteps

1. **Adapt to Google algorithm evolution**: Keep abreast of Google updates and modify the website when necessary to maintain favorable search visibility and increased organic traffic.

2. **Track organic traffic trends**: Consistent monitoring of a website's organic traffic helps to identify sudden fluctuations and devise appropriate corrective strategies to mitigate financial repercussions.

3. **Audit and adjust indexing settings**: Developers must meticulously examine indexing settings in the Dev environment and remove lingering noindex or nofollow tags that could compromise the site's accessibility.

4. **Uphold web development best practices**: Adherence to industry guidelines and proven practices enables developers to create secure, user-friendly, and SEO-oriented websites that effectively bolster online presence.

Overlooking these aspects can result in dwindling website performance in organic search, leading to considerable financial losses for B2B businesses. Emphasizing sound web development and continuous monitoring of website metrics can prevent such issues, ensuring sustainable financial well-being.
