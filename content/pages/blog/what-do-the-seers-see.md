I’ve been running with this idea in opposition to ‘world domination’

A world where the structures that are built are not done so for hidden reasons or without transparency. There’s far too many examples of social systems or ‘contracts,’ with the purpose of making a better world.

And for a great majority of history, it has… as the cost of great violence is the price for such a world.

It would be rather undeniable to assume that the age of unrest is only just beginning. In the same vein, one has to wonder what will be the foundation the ‘next’ world will be on.

What do the seers see?

In a world so dependent on technology, a race-to-the-bottom-line mentality has overtaken corporate culture in respect to consumers, to those employed, or to those exploited? It’s manic.

Suppose social media never goes away, and at this point who’s denying that, what’s going to be the ‘natural’ symbiosis of ‘next-generation’ digital social distribution?

My assumption is that those who understand how to create / maintain any link in the economic chain, can be run by local people, simultaneously, globally, with the technology that is currently the norn for government black book programs, intelligence agencies, or the military.

I’m referring to a digital platform, akin to blockchain (a public, decentralized ledger), that will facilitate social, economic, political, governmental, logistical, & geopolitical success, from the ground-up.

Localized... Globalism.

Eventually these mega-conglomerate data organizations will fall.

This next form of civilized technological application will be one that has to thrive on change, the same change nature uses, in order to find symbiotic balance.

We’re all already offering up this information, anyway. The age of weaponized content is upon us. Throw it all on blockchain and make it live on the darkweb. 

Eventually the internet will evolve, too.

To perfect progress.
