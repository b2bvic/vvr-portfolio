Hello and grand risings on this Thor’s Day.

Thor, is the same character archetype as: the Sun, Jupiter, Ammon, Zeus, Je-Zeus (Jesus).

You know, since all mythology is basically telling the same story about our reality, we’re just getting hung up on character reboots and differences.
  
This is something that is hard to convey because most people want the beliefs they chose to be the correct.

  

Unfortunately, none of them are correct.

  

And all of them are.

  

Each mythology within this reality is describing a certain…. Nature about our, well nature.

  

Furthermore, it’s my belief that Pantheons of Gods exist to explain the dynamics between certain influences within the human mind.

  

Even-further-more, I realize that “mythology” as we understand it today, is misrepresented on two fronts:

  

1.  Modern culture teaches us that each ancient ‘mythology’ is about worship, akin to religion.
    
2.  Modern humans don’t realize our two biggest mythologies, outright.  
      
    

So, the first point.

  

If you were to time travel to Ancient Greece, they would be proclaiming victory by the Gods and praying to them in ways which are quite similar to our own religions.

  

But, if you were to walk up to any one of them and ask, “So what’s your mythos?”

  

They would probably be confused.

  

They don’t have a mythology; this is their way of life.

  

Let’s travel further back to Ancient Kemet. An empire known for its empirical study of nature, man, and mathematics (among many other things).

  

Their “mythology” is more like a methodology, a specific process for interacting with the environment around them to produce replicable results, which were then represented as Hieroglyphic record. 

  

Does this sound familiar?

  

Let’s lead into the second point now.

  

Bar none, the largest mythology currently engulfing Earth, is science.

  

This isn’t to say that science is false.

  

Because to us, modern humans, it holds value within our perspective of explaining the world around us.

  

The difference between Buddhism (neuroscience) or Kemetian ‘myth’ (natural sciences) and “Modern” Science:

  

Is the medium by which it is explained, applied, and believed.

  

We assume that science finds all truth, and live our daily lives in tune with these findings.

  

Theory of Gravity? Better not just jump off a roof.

  

Theory of Plate Tectonics? Oh that’s why the ground shakes, cool.

  

Theory of Relativity? You mean space is time and matter is energy? Cool.

  

These are not proven natural law, like Newton’s Thermodynamics.

  

But are rather cool assumptions about how this place operates, from the perspective of Post-Renaissance thought.

  

Next time you hear someone babble on about science as all-knowing truth, take it with a grain of salt, because they’re probably indoctrinated to solely believe in ScientISM, instead of considering all disciplines of thought.

  

Remember, humans have always been this smart.

  

And we’re very likely not the first hominids to get this far in intellect.

  

Onto the second point:

  

Modern Mythology surrounds us every day in the form of Comics, Movies, Video Games, Pop Culture, allat.

  

Marvel Comics? A complete Pantheon.

  

Billboard top 40? Audial representation of ‘values’ set within a certain timeframe.

  

Brand Loyalty? Sports teams?  
  
Nationalism????

  

Myth, myth, myth.

  

But, this is just my opinion and perspective.

  

I tend to not subscribe to one belief so I can observe the truth it it all.

  

This worldview is known as Syncretism: the amalgamation or attempted amalgamation of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought.

  

Some popular syncretists are Santos Bonacci and Sevan Bomar.

  

They do a really good job of bridging the gaps between Myth, Numerology, Astro-Theology, and Language.

  

All of which serve the same mean when studied separately: disconnection.

  

But together, they serve to explain the patterns of Nature and Humanity.

  

So let’s not get hung up on the differences.

  

Yeah?

  

Cool.

  

Let’s take a breath.

  

Thank you for reading.
