There comes a certain point when a person has to realize the caricature of character they’ve made of themselves is too far removed to continue.

I think this is what happened tonight as the dude who pretends to be Machiavelli tried to smoke another dude who reads numbers like reality’s cheat codes.

Illimitable Man understands when a persona has ‘gone too far.’

He’s still an idiot.

Authenticity is the ultimate move in a world that is littered with people who are just authentic enough to bastardize a problem with a half-baked solution and some fancy, emotional writing.

We’re all marketers.

Human interaction at its most basic is a level of marketing that was innate within our communications and likely was a driving force for phonetics.

Think about this for a second,

How do you prove to another person that whatever you’re saying is valuable to them?

You appeal to their emotions.

Let’s synthesize this for a moment.

Why do you think language was created?

It was to convey warning.

After human beings learned that fluctuating in vocal tone can invoke different emotional responses, arrangements of these sounds were developed in order to create deeper meaning and nuance.

But then what came next?

We began to selectively display the traits that would make ‘us’ more ‘valuable’ to a person associated with us.

This is marketing.

When you selectively base your interactions to curate a response, 

You’re marketing.

Humans have another word for this phenomenon.

It’s called ‘Personality.’

Personality requires the verification of others, in order to solidify value within a social interaction.

When you are alone, we typically ‘act’ a bit different.

That’s because, when you’re alone, you no longer put on that mask.

You become an individual.

This is the problem with Illimitable Man.

He’s a personality, actually, worse than that, he’s the persona of a personality that isn’t even his.

Hiding behind images of likeness that aren’t his own, referring to writing that isn’t his own.

This is the problem with Critics.

They rarely create.

This is what distinguishes him from a dude like Gary.

That man puts his name on everything and has called some ridiculous ass shit out in the past.

IM has done nothing other than taught autistic red-pill boys-to-men who attempt at snarky commentary about intelligence.

Keyboard warriors galore.

Personally, I am a person that writes exactly like I speak, speak just as often as I tweet, have my actual face and name on display, and am viciously aware of my authenticity.

Fuck you if you don’t like me.

But chances are you do because you’re reading this.

So pardon the language.

It’s too easy for me to pick ‘one’ “niche” that i can target and sell a solution to.

I’d rather go for the bigger fish.

This is the difference between an armchair personality and a real life individual.

I could leave twitter, tomorrow, forever, and you’d still know i’m getting my shit done.

No accolades are needed other than providing a better world than the one I found.

In an attempt to apply this macro behavior, i treat every day with the same mindset, personally, daily.

Today, I am better than the dude who ran this body yesterday.

Even though I know time doesn’t really exist without a perspective, and that all is ‘now,’ it’s the easiest way to maneuver through manure.

“Man, you’re always on.”

More so than i can ever explain.

You are strong.

You are loved.

You are free.

Thank you for reading, 

Your friend,

Victor V.
