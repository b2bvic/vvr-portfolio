Your thoughts operate as keywords do.

Consciously, this can come to you as ideas, emotions, or dreams.

But subconsciously, they are signals of wants, needs, or desires.

These are the same mechanisms ‘inside your head’.

The amount of data that gets collected from your search queries are innumerable. I couldn’t list them all here because I’m not an Engineer at Google, but I can take a stab in the dark and see what bleeds.

Here are some factors that, I assume, effect your search results page:

-   Your age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status
-   Whether you’re a homeowner or renter
-   Whether you’re single, currently in a relationship, or married
-   The IP address of your data connection
-   The time of day / week / month / year
-   How many times you’ve searched the same terms in the past
-   If you’ve never searched that term in the past
-   The location you’re currently in
-   The locations you have visited in the past
-   The locations you’re planning to visit, and have searched for
-   If you search beyond page 1 of the results page
-   If you clicked on an ad related to a search
-   If you clicked on an ad directly on the search page
-   Your YouTube watch + search history
-   Your YouTube viewing habits
-   Your spending habits during different times of the month
-   Whether you’re on Android or iPhone
-   The apps on your phone, their permissions, and their usage stats
-   Your on-screen time for any internet-connected devices
-   Your keystrokes (many apps have keyloggers, messaging apps are notorious for this)
-   Your social media habits (following, followers, content preferences)

All of these things, and more, come into play when we think about your conscious and unconscious habits. 

Never before in human history has this much data been tracked. Never.

There’s now so much data that it requires the assistance of AI and massive server-farms to not only house, but parse the data into something useful. Something that can be used to control you.

It may seem daunting and scary, but that’s the world we live in.

I hope this information empowers you to use these devices with a bit more intention and care.

**Especially for the sake of your unsupervised children’s internet access.**
