## Stoking The Flame of Creativity

Someone close to me said, _"I've never seen someone just so... sure of themselves. Like you know what you want to do is going to happen. How do you do that?"_

Well, it started at an extremely young age, as I was a precocious child with an very high reading / math level.

I started to develop the confidence that I had skills and abilities. It began as sort of a defense mechanism because i was an extremely smol boy.

Until i was about 6, people thought I was still a toddler. I can't give a metric on how tall i was, but i was little.

I was commonly mistaken as a child that couldn't do things alone / needed help.

Soon enough, I realized that unless I displayed overt surety, I would be doubted.

Doubt, in my eyes, was failure before the attempt.

So, growing up, I never let this flame die. I stoked the fires of confidence until more of my creativity developed.

This reached it's pinnacle for me when I was in high school and started performing with local Ska bands on Trombone.

Without that spark, that internal igniter enabling the explosive reaction, I would have been dead in the water long ago, lost in my own self-doubt and crushing expectations.

Being sure in a result before taking part in an action can be dangerous if not properly calculated for your ability, skill level, or expertise. Don't overshoot or overreach.

Know where your lane is, but drive the shit out of that road.

The lane is yours only with the confidence that you can handle it.

Too often I notice people put themselves into a catatonic state before undertaking a large project, test, performance, whatever.

There has been no avenue in my life where confidence didn't serve me well.

I wouldn't have performed Beatboxing routines in middle school.

Would have never gotten into music because of it.

Would have never performed locally.

Would have never understood deeper levels of myself. The fire inside which doesn't burn away.

Stoke your creative flame today. Refer back to the first email about starting if you're unsure where to begin.

There is nothing you can't accomplish — within reason — so long as you have the confidence to at least TRY.

That's it.

Remember to breathe.

And then again, deeper.

We've got a world to create.
