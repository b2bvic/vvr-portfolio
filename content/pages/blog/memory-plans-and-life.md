It’s taken a week of adjusting but I’m finally to the point of accepting my life will never go according to plan.

While that may either be incomprehensible to you or something that’s totally obvious will come down to your level of understanding the way that things around here.

I say this a lot because it’s still one of the harder concepts I have issues with:

Your path is meant for you.

I don’t mean to say that a person attracts their trauma, but they are completely capable of growing from any experience they have encountered.

There are people I know in my life that would prefer to believe that once you’re broken that’s sort of the end-all-be-all, causing a stunt in any growth that may be possible.

This, to me, couldn’t be farther from the truth as I see it displayed in the world.

For sake of argument, let’s say a person is brutally raped and tortured as a child, succumbing to the worst that this world has to offer a sovereign being.

There are two basic routes this person will end up taking in their lives (with obviously many more that are possible but we’re thinking fundamentals, bear with me, i’m making a point):

1.  Non-Growth: At the absolute worst case scenario of this person’s life, they become the type to not only associate with all of their experiences, but want to make others feel as helpless as they have.

This is a dangerous mindset. These are the types of people that become the exact perpetrators which were endured. 

There is likely no coincidence that ‘Perpetrate’ and ‘Perpetuate’ have nearly the same spelling.

When a person solely identifies by the experiences they have endured, it consumes them beyond the experiences themselves.

A quick reminder that there are (obviously) many variations that this mindset can take. This is the most extreme in order to get a gauge on the range

2.  Growth: At the absolute best case scenario of this person’s life, they become the type to learn that their experiences in life don’t define them unless they allow it to.

We all go through some amount of Trauma in our lives, even those who lived a life without strife still had to be born. No one comes through this realm without first having to leave the first Universe they’ve never known, the womb.

A person utilizes the pain they’ve experienced as a motivation to have compassion towards other humans.

Simple.

So, you go through something horrible in life, to you: that could mean poverty, abuse, tragedy, whatever. 

I have noticed in my friends and family the mindsets which perpetuate the feelings of trauma that we encounter initially.

I’ve written extensively on the subjects of indoctrinaiton, mind, and mantras. These 3 subjects emcompass all i’m explaining here.

When we take a situation that happens to us and replicate it in our minds, we are often MIS-remembering the events that actually happen.

It could be simple details, like the color of a room, the expression on a face, or the feelings that were happening in real time.

But there’s something tricky about the way that mind works: when you recall an event, you are actually remembering the LAST time you remembered it.

Imagine playing a game of telephone: after 30 conduits (or mental repetition) the entire message can become so skewed that it’s nothing like the original.

So, how does any of this nonsense relate to the original point of this writing?

Oh right: your path is meant for you.

There have been experiences in my life which led to great insight, by the measure of some others, these can be seen as particularly traumatic, uplifting, scary, surprising, inspiring, devastating, or even ecstatic.

Of course, these are the measure of others; not the way I see my life personally.

Judging by the range of interpretation capable by humans, as shown in the variance of reaction to my explanation of my experience, I finally innerstand how silly it is to hold any emotional attachment to what has, or will happen to me.

Which brings me back to the first sentence of this post:

I’m finally releasing the idea of life going “according to plan.”

Why?

Because plans precede the experience of an action.

Can you see the chain? It’s all a story in some sort of vicious circle, in 4 dimensions as you move beyond time. Read this a few times:

Humans outright,

try to out-write,

the experiences of their actions,

before they happen

or

after they do,

mis-remembered either way,

to create a reasoning behind “personality;”

justifying or rationalizing potentially destructive behavior.

Trippy, right?

It’s like this weird vortex that sucks you up because you’re too caught up with:

the past affecting your present (guilt),

the past affecting the future (anxiety),

the future affecting the present (stress),

the present affecting your future (fear),

What will you allow yourself to stay beholden to? 

A story from the past?

A story for the future?

The present always is.

Future / Past exist on some other plane of existence, all we have here, is now.

Always, all ways.

Breathing is a good way to be present.

(That’s tomorrow’s subject, stay tuned.)

Until then.

All the best,

Victor
