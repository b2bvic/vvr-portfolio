What’s up.

It’s been a long weekend of reflection. 

I have some thoughts on the way we move through the world and the intention that is carried with us through our actions. 

Part of which, is recognizing the parts of myself which lay dormant for the better half of the last 20 years. 

The thing is, we don’t often find out about our deepest-seated behaviors until we’ve already become destructive to ourselves or to others.

I know I’m speaking on internal issues, but this stems in all parts of life.

Career, Business Relationships, Personal Relationships, even down to the ways we talk to ourselves…

It’s all connected.

The last few years I’ve been known for giving people the tools to search within themselves. The horrible irony is that it took years for me to recognize that recognition of these tools is not the same thing as utilizing them myself.

It’s funny in a ‘not-funny’ way.

But recently I discovered that my earliest memories, the deepest parts of myself, are rooted in the abuse that my father inflicted onto my mother.

They were teenagers. This isn’t an excuse, but it’s context.

These times were the unconscious development, the formative years, of my life.

Right around 13, I realized my emotions are extremely volatile. What was my natural response? Shut that shit down. This is where my cognitive dissonance began.

Because I would constantly fight, argue, and battle anyone for the sake of finding certainty. To be sure in my perspective. It was a deep emotional investment, although I cloaked it in such a way that didn’t feel like emotions.

As I grew older, around my first real relationship at 16, I began to convince myself that I was sociopathic, because I was successful in shutting the ‘emotional’ parts of myself down. I forgot how to connect with people. I was extremely cold during this time and unfortunately, I took my latent frustration out on her.

Over the last few weeks I’ve experienced deep empathy with those I am closest to, those I am deeply invested.

And luckily, I was able to pose a question to my original partner, “Who was I before? How have I changed?”

She hit me with a wisdom built on 13 years of familiarity.

She described to me, that I seem to be a person that thrives on the certainty of truth, because I was conceived in uncertainty.

It wasn’t until I basically broke my own mind due to psychedelics, endured numerous bouts of psychosis & disassociation to find the truth…

I’ve inherited my father’s psychopathy.

Now, I don’t literally think he’s a psychopath. He’s definitely insane. Definitely has ‘voices’ in his head.

He stopped growing mentally at the age of 14, when he became I runaway (he was 16 days into being 19 years old when I was born.) Basically, he’s still that age now and about to be 45.

Toeing-the-line with psychedelics has brought me to the ‘point of no return’. One more bad intention during a trip and I will not be able to bring myself back from that brink.

It’s a sobering thought, but it’s one that I reached through my experimentation. 

I have literally inherited the mindset that my father is currently dealing with now, except I have the awareness that it’s coming on.

That’s a whole other post tbh, I don’t want to get into it right now.

But the point of all of that is this… 

If you don’t discover the deepest parts within yourself, and drive them to the surface, you’ll never understand why you’ve made the choices you’ve made up until this point.

You’ll never find your calling, your motivations, your skills, your drive.

These are the most important parts of the unique-ness that is you.

Do the hard work, preferably without psychedelics, I cannot, in my right mind, recommend ANYONE take the route I have taken.

I have said it in the past, but for everyone else, my path is not yours.

Practice breathwork, yoga, meditation.

Drive yourself into your muscle tension, your mind tension, your breathing tension.

The answers await you there.

But only if you swear you’ll do the work.
