SEO is such a vast subject that you will spend 80% of your time getting to 20% mastery alone

YouTube University can only take you so far if you don’t understand how information is weighed against the selection and order of your words in the search bar

A local business owner I met on Saturday told me that he spent “hundreds of hours studying this stuff”

**And you know what? It showed:**
- Lean WordPress build
- Site speed clocked < 1 second
- Grasp of SEO concepts (metadata, schema, ranking)

But do you know what else he had?

Some very glaring but *easy-to-fix* problems:

1.  Missing Descriptions
2.  Titles Too Long / Short
3.  STOLEN CONTENT FROM OTHER SITES

“I copied some stuff but left the author and links in there as credit”

WAT. You can’t do that.

Here’s why:

- The content is crawled somewhere else
- With the same exact backlink structure
- To affiliate links that aren’t his

But you know the crazy part?

**My guy was STILL ranking top 10 SERP for every original article. Even with blatant duplication.**
Have we learned anything?

Let’s recap:

1. Teaching yourself SEO creates blind spots

2. Blind spots due to lack of search engine skill

3. 80% is done correct

4. 20% is worst shit you’ll ever do to a website in your career

There’s a good chance his website traffic increases once the duplicated content is removed and metadata is brought in line with current standards. Then just running for the hills with a content writer.

Don’t underestimate a second pair of eyes.
