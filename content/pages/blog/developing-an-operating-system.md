I’ve spent the last few weeks learning a whole lot about systems. And what comes as a surprise to me is that it’s the next evolutionary step in the profession (or career) I've chosen for my life. 

What started out as a passion for writing, turned into a passion for marketing, culminated into media production, and is now one more step removed as my primary ‘next step’ is figuring out how to run all the media / marketing procedures simultaneously, automatically.

It’s a daunting task; but those are the only kind that really get me up in the morning. I hadn’t realized this was the solution to my problem of feeling like “I wasn’t doing enough” in my current environment. I felt as though, and I mentioned this in one of the previous emails a few weeks back, that I was too focused on just “surviving” to feel like I was making progress in any other field of my life. 

Once I got back from California, having already risked my life a few times due to poor decision-making, completely ignoring the work I was set to accomplish during my time away, I put this company on my back and began to focus on the problems that were most important. 

Primarily, it was filling the gaps of where others had left off. 

The last few weeks have been a balancing act of:

1.  Keeping my own brand / writing / freelance clients afloat
2.  Maintaining & optimizing my primary client’s brand
3.  Developing potential clients for the new company
4.  Single-handedly producing all media of above
5.  Creating the systems that will eventually replace my input, for all the above

It’s a lot. It’s a lot more than I’m used to doing, but it’s not outside my wheelhouse.

There were times in my past, only a decade ago, when I was putting up facades to everyone in my life, each had a different version of myself that they’d interact with. I thought it was normal until I got arrested. That’s another email.

This is not so much different. My goal in life has never been to be the best at anything, but find creative ways to connect all that I’m interested in. Except instead of being deceptive, it’s about connecting my skill sets. 

I just hadn’t realized how much work goes into building a company, proving a concept, and keeping all of my work relationships happy, while attempting to have some sort of social life (which has sort of been in shambles, but I digress.)

What it comes down to, is grit. How bad do you want it?

I know that I would not be in this current situation if I couldn’t handle it. That’s not how a cumulative process works. Your life is an aggregation of your own efforts coupled with the influences of others. Who you choose to have around you at any given time, is going to inevitably affect your work ethic, mindset, motivation, and how you view yourself in context of the greater whole.

This brings me back to the main point, systems. It’s one thing to have a routine down, or even be disciplined, but it’s a whole other to develop a system that can operate whether or not you feel like it.

That’s what I’m working towards right now. Given my track record, I assume to have these systems down-pat, regardless of application, by the time I turn 27 in December. 

I’m coming up on a year away from my hometown and have already grown to be unrecognizable to who I once was. In light of any amount of change you’re going through, it’s important that you honor who you were in the past, the people that were closest to you during those times, and where you are heading with your current ‘tribe.’ 

It’s all too important in today’s world.

Develop systems. [Message me if you have no idea where to start](http://www.beremarqable.com/victor).

I’m only on Step 2 or 3, but teaching you Step 1 will help me develop Step 4.

It’s funny how it works like that.

Thanks for reading.
