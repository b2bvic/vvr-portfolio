Most people would have you believe that their careers just happened for them. An opportunity came about, they took it, and then worked for the last umpteen years as their responsibilities grew to meet their means.

Now, depending upon where you’re at in your life, you may have already found yourself that career and have put some time into it. Perhaps it has been a couple of positions in the same field, with varying levels of roles to play within a company, or people to run under you. This I amor likely if you’re older, say above the age of 33.

Other times, and this is what I find most common with people in my direct age group (18-32), you encounter companies that don’t quite fit your needs, or is in a field you don’t see yourself flourishing within. That’s completely fair too.

There’s nothing wrong with either of these scenarios. The job market has always existed to serve the corporation’s interests over the interests of the workers. That’s the achilles heel to capitalism as we understand it today.

Gone are those that picked up a job straight out of high school and worked the same company for their entire lifetime. In fact, the only person I know who did accomplish something like that was a man who pulled 50 years at Yamaha in Southern California. He was celebrated with a modest trophy and a highlight during the company’s yearly internal conference or something.

Think about that.

Finally, Let’s Talk Shop

Now that we’re past the introduction, I want to get into the whole point of this writing:

“It’s Their Job But It’s Your Career” is the idea that no matter the job market conditions, the economic conditions, or corporate conditions, that you find a way to make your employment a win-win situation between you and the company currently employing you.

Now, you might be wondering, “How exactly does a person go about performing this feat?” But I haven’t read that far into the book yet…

The parts that I have read struck me with this inspiration because it was incidentally the path that I’ve had over my own career.

When you move from position to position, company to company, what are you doing to proactively ensure that you’re moving along a career path that makes sense for your goals, interests, and passions?

How does one ensure that job-hopping doesn’t screw them out of their youth, the most important time a person has in terms of energy & willpower?

Seeking & Meeting The Challenge of Growth

**Seeking & Meeting The Challenge of Growth**
I’ve only ever needed to lie for an interview one time. It was for the first corporate marketing position I would ever have.

The reason I lied is because I knew I could teach myself anything these Boomers would ask of me before they realized I was teaching it to myself.

Do you want to know what was on this list of lies?

1.  Email Marketing
2.  Graphic Design
3.  Amazon Advertising (Copywriting)

I was in there because the position was for a ‘Marketing Coordinator’. So this didn’t seem too far out of the wheelhouse.

Now, I was familiar with all of these concepts, but had never practiced them before. I wasn’t longer than about 6 days before I had enough of a handle on these activities. There isn’t a company on Earth that would expect you to impact everything on their criteria list within the first week. 

Beyond that though, beyond what was on the application, my resume, and the interview questions, there were other - far more important aspects to consider. 

Each of them having to do with how I conducted myself in my study, my communication, and a willingness to explore options with patience that I’d soon become known for at that office. 

I worked each day to ensure that my position within that company would not be one they’d regret.

That's where we leave off today...

I have part 2 in the queue for you tomorrow.

If you have ANY questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to share them with me. I would love to hear them.
