That was a powerful experience.

I called my 18 year old self forward, I started to breathe as if I were sobbing.

No tears came out.

I felt his pain.

I felt his regret.

I felt his need for redemption.

THREAD: Alchemy, Pain, and our Inner-Story.

Ocean‚Äôs 6 was our running-joke of a name until we were arrested.

A string of burglaries within our school district that lasted 6 months.

We were stealing electronics and musical instruments from local schools.

Justifying these actions in our minds as though we were some sort of ‚ÄòRobin Hood‚Äô outfit.

You see, these materials were severely outdated and were being replaced because of our actions.

Although, after 6 months, the fun ended.

We were caught.

Each of us were brought up on Felony Vandalism, Breaking & Entering, Trespassing, and Grand Larceny.

I had the most felonies, at 12.

The consequences of my actions were all too real:

-   I was (again) expelled from school

-   I would not become Drum Major my senior year

-   I disappointed my entire family

My public defender told me I was looking at 20 years.

Me, being me, worked the system by completing 40 hours of community service and obtaining 3 letters of character by teachers from my high school.

It was just enough to keep me from going away for a long time.

Although, I still internalized the SHAME from those actions.

Unbeknownst to me, I still carried them with me today.

As I sat for my meditation, these feelings of inadequacy and defeat flooded me.

I began to quiver, breathing quickly.

This was the 18 year old me. The pain.

I spoke softly to myself. Providing reassurance.

This is me, being the older mentor I needed while 17.

I realized that a lot of this internalized shame was the fuel to my fire.

I needed to prove myself.

I needed that redemption.

On some basic level: I held blame for the consequences of those actions.

The largest of all, being the suicide of my best friend.


My breathing would not come into control, so I laid back, giving myself a hug as I bathed in the hot sunlight.

After some time, I felt the weight lift.¬†

My breathing returned to normal.

The 18 year old me relaxed, eased up.

I wrote only a few hours ago that we are not the internal story that we tell ourselves.

It was now that I innerstand what that means.

I feel as though the file in my memories from 2010-2013 were finally closed.

That era of my life has long since ended, but the sting of that pain lingered.

After laying down, I sat for another 10 mins, still as ever.

Then I took a brief walk.

Now?

I feel light.

Lighter than I‚Äôve felt in years.

I know I must do this for each year of my life.

Forgive myself for my mistakes.

Forgive myself of any shame that is buried deep.

The catalyst is the breath.

The culmination of your experience can be called forth at any point in time.

Just be sure you‚Äôre ready to be that person you knew you always were.

Provide that love.

And watch yourself grow.

I hope this thread has served you well.

Thank you for reading.
