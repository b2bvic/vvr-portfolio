Yesterday I relit a flame that was nearly extinguished.

It was decided that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough work to actively achieve my goals.

So, after I clocked out from my day job, I went to the nearest Starbucks.

I sat for an additional 5 hours, finished a paid article, and got further along in the design of my website.

I mentioned that a person trying to accomplish their dreams must take an inch at every opportunity possible.

This is still absolutely true.

However, attempting to pursue multiple avenues at the same time, leaves for a shorter amount of growth at any possible moment.

I have a lot of projects that I‚Äôm a part of:

-   dropshipping stores

-   freelance copywriting work

-   a marketing agency

-   consulting for start-ups

-   video conferences

-   teaching piano lessons

-   the daily desk job

-   learning new skills / practicing old ones

-   socializing with friends

-   reading new books

-   growing my twitter

-   revising coursework

-   writing for fun.

These are all being handled at any given point of time, my being is becoming more and more stretched.

It‚Äôs not the least bit stressful on my part, a good entrepreneur must be able to handle multiple projects at the same time.¬†

However, when taking only an inch at a time, and split between 13 avenues, how is a person to gain any measurable ground?

Fact of the matter is, you (I) won‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs just not feasible.

It‚Äôs not probable.

But possible?

Anything is possible.

Just because it seems hard, doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be.

Everything seems hard at first.

But then you fall into a pattern, catch your rhythm, begin to understand the ebb & flow.

I have never been one to follow the norm.

There are numerous examples throughout history of notable writers, musicians, polymaths, inventors, painters, sculptors, architects, etc.

Fewer examples of people who did a numerous amount of these disciplines at the same time.

Do not limit yourself based on the limited vision and perspective of others.

They do not know you.

You know you.

Logically, you‚Äôre the only person who had known you since your birth.

Not your parents.

Not your siblings.

Not your friends.

No one.

A person knows of their limitations inherently.

This should not stop them from pursuing the next discipline with an earnest wonder.

Every person on this planet has the capabilities to become a mangnanamous influence on their world.

Stop waiting for permission.

Stop following those who will never understand.

Do not limit yourself based on the limits of others.

You want the world? Go get it.

Start now.

The time is always now.

Begin, be-G-in.

Until tomorrow,

‚Äî Victor Valentine Romo
