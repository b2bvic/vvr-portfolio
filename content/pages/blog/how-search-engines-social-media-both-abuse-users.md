That may come as a bit of a shock to you and that’s okay, but I’ll explain.

Twitter, or any social media network for that matter, operate with the same exact mechanisms that Search Engine Optimization does.

Before I get into what those mechanisms are, let’s lay down some ground rules:

1.  Both Social Media and SEO use Audiences as their primary vector.
2.  User Generated Content is no different from User Generated Keywords. They’re saying the same thing from different ends.
3.  Building like-minded “silos” of Audiences is the goal for both SEO and Social Media.

Okay, got those? I’m going to break them down one by one, then will come the knockout blow at the end that ties it all together

How Social Media & Search Engines Both Use Audiences

When you think of an audience you may think of a group of people that enjoy the same content as you.

You may think of an audience as a group of people that will buy something from you.

You may think of an audience as a search term that you put into Google.

All 3 of these are saying the exact same thing. They’re all audiences.

People that enjoy the same content as you are the same people that will want to purchase from similar ads you see. The more ads in common = the more IN common that person has with you.

When you think about ads, you have to consider your own purchasing habits and what those rotate around.

No matter how unique you are, I can show you 10,000 other people with a data-connected smartphone that will purchase the exact same shit you do. Guaranteed.

Let’s flip that, say you’re an advertiser, a Search Engine Marketer. 

You test your copy, your creative, the labels you associate to the A/B testing. Why?

Because you’re searching for the right audience for your offer.

Does that make sense to both of you? One of you makes ads and one of you buys from ads.

But don’t get it twisted, even the marketers are not immune to marketing. The ads only get more specific. ;)

User Generated Content & User Generated Keywords Are The Same Thing

Going back to point number 2. Here’s the simplest way it can be put:

User Generated Keywords are used to connect them to User Generated Content.

Why is this? Because words & language are the basis of all human communication and we’ve evolved from books so this is the next thing.

The crazy part is, we’re rapidly moving into solely Video Results & Voice Searches so soon the visual language itself will be less important.

(I think we may see a drastic decline in Literacy in the future if we move away from typing and more into talk-to-type - that’s my hot take tho.)

Does that make sense? You find content with words online. It’s the only way to.

Let’s keep pushin.

Audiences on Social Media Are The Same Audiences on Search Engines

This is point 3 but it can only be made with the previous two points.

There are 10,000 people who search the same shit as you, buy the same shit as you, or run the same ads you run (that’s what CPC is).

These “collections” or “labels” or “keywords” of people exist within the same silos on Search Engines and Social Media.

-   If you consume content, you’re in a category.
-   If you create content, you’re in a category.
-   If you buy from ads, you’re in a category
-   If you create ads, you’re in a category.
-   If you search on google, you’re in a category.
-   If you market on google, you’re in a category.

Here’s The Final Point That If You Skipped To You May Not Get It

When we think of the way social media is used, it’s upside-down SEO.

You’re not using keywords, you’re creating or consuming the content. 

You’re directly connecting with those people. 

The medium of connection is different (language vs. verbal / bodily communication) but the end goal is the same.

To specify your attention within a category.

Thank you for reading.
