Failing at something sucks. It doesn't feel good.

So naturally, we attempt to avoid it. 

But this doesn't solve the problem.

You still suck at that thing.

You'll just never give yourself the opportunity to increase your aptitude.

You robbing from you. 

What does it mean to fail?

  

## The Nature Of Failure

To fail simply means that you've attempted something that is just outside your current state.

It doesn't matter what it is. Everyone goes through it. 

The people that you see as masters, are really just those that are most familiar with what it means to fail.

Failure is a litmus test. 

One of the easiest ways to become more adjusted to failure is to attempt more things. 

If you find yourself extremely skilled at every single activity you partake in, you aren't challenging yourself enough to grow.

When was the last time you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone?

When was the last time you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone and it humbled you?

Being humbled by your attempts to succeed means you're testing new ways to get there. 

Never fear failure. Fear the day you stop looking for new ways to fail.

It won't be too long from that day where you'll meet your demise.

  

## Success Is Not The Absence Of Failure

When you accept the fact that success is not the absence of failure, you begin to take each failure to heart, less.

It becomes less important to you to be successful on the first try.

This is also a behavior that is learned in youth. 

"Gifted" children know this all too well. 

If you're the type of person to take to new activities quickly, and fail to do so within a self-described limit, your likelihood to make another attempts falls to zero.

I've talked about how you can [make better attempts in a previous issue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/subtlebodhi/issues/3-steps-to-success-for-your-1st-attempt-1074177). 

That strategy was born from a childhood of internalized frustration at failure within the first few attempts.

When you learn to become jaded to this sort of conflict within yourself, you unlock a level of patience that introduces you to success with a higher average.

It's all a numbers game. You put in the amount of reps required to be comfortable with the risk of failure.

And don't forget, failure is an ever-present temptation. That's what it means to make an attempt.

  

## If Going Forward Is Not An Option, Go Back

The second pass carries more information than the first.

This concept is easy enough for most people to understand. 

Sometimes, not getting to your solution is not severe enough to be called a failure.

If you find your current strategy not panning out, there is nothing wrong with a revision. 

Go back a ways and look with your new perspective and understanding.

The steps in your learning process, the exploration of those steps, should never be considered a failure.

Too many of us in this world are comparing our first attempt with another's one hundred thousandth attempt.

Failure is nothing more than a stepping stone to your success, should you choose to see it as such.

You don't really fail until you stop trying. 

You don't really fail until you give up.
