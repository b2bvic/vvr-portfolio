Humans are Avatars.

Many people would say, “DUHHH” while others are probably wondering what exactly I mean.

I, just a few minutes ago, stared at myself in the mirror for 15 minutes continuously.

If i’m not mistaken, this is a form of “scrying.”

According to what I’ve read, it often causes ‘visuals’ or ‘distortions’ of the reflection.

I’ll tell you what,

I turned into an Alex Grey painting.

Not only this, but this form of meditation was combined with the typical form of meditation I practice, that is allow thoughts to bubble up and fizzle away.

Without regard for what inspired them, where they’re going, or what the subject at hand.

This is when I started to feel the heat from my body vibrate.

I was sensing the radiation of heat from my inner-body.

Something else then struck me as I began to realize my breathing pattern and the blood flowing within my body:

I began to realize the four elements that are at play within the human body.

Fire: Homeostasis

Water: Blood and Lymph

Earth: Carbon / Elements

Air: Oxygen / Carbon Dioxide

This culmination of elements is present within us at all times. It’s irrefutable, if you’re alive, these objectives need to be fulfilled. If one is suddenly restricted or missing, the self will perish.

Now, as my vision started to become distorted, I noticed the little nuances of my body.

Movements that didn’t exactly feel like a conscious effort on my part.

This isn’t the first time I’ve stood in front of a mirror as a meditation but it has definitely been a while.

Onward we go... further into the depth of my innerstanding these elemental forces at play within the body.

Every person has a specific time and date at which they were birthed in this reality.

Whether or not you “believe” in Astronomical influence over your life, one cannot deny the vibrational implications that other planets have on this one.

Inb4, “that’s bullshit Victor”

I’m a musician, are you aware of the Sound of the Spheres?

EVEN IF we remove the whole cosmic implication, humans are still pattern-seeking creatures.

Who’s to say that seasonal environmental changes don’t leave an imprint on a developing fetus which could be observed on the culmination of these changes, which we call ‘birth’?

Did I lose you?

Let me explain…

Humans know when to plant seeds, know when to harvest, know how to read the weather and stars, can chart oceanic currents, can create ‘currencies’ which fluctuate THEN predict THOSE ‘market’ changes.

Humans are driven by patterns.

Not only in their own motivations for interacting with this reality.

But also in the way reality interacts with their motivations outright.

Humans are driven by patterns.

Without removing the voice in your head that’s always vying for your attention, you’ll never become keen to the patterns that lie dormant and pretty much run your entire reality.

Your habits, preferences, experiences, genetics, socio-economic upbringing, religion, philosophy, politics, media influence, culture, pop culture, music preference, fashion, views inherited from parents / family / friends / lovers are not likely your own.

This can be argued on a few fronts, and I welcome you to smashing that little blue bird when you finish reading to fume your rage.

I’m ready for the heat.

But in all seriousness, these are the lenses that our realities are viewed through on a daily basis.

I can only speak on the behalf of my own, and if you’ve known me for any given amount of time longer than a week, you’ll know how quick I am to switch / update / or completely revoke qualities of myself that don’t serve a greater purpose.

Staring at yourself in the mirror is one of the few ways I’ve noticed an immediate discomfort with the practice.

This is something that shouldn’t be a surprise, because we’ve been programmed since birth to not appreciate our appearances. Worse yet the mirrors that are popular today lack the same ‘depth’ that others view us.

And since we can never see ourselves as OTHERS see us, we may miss out on the magic that others experience when interacting with us.

This is how meditation, especially this version of it, has served me in taking an objective look at myself, my life, and the culminating experience of each interaction i’ve made across my life.

I can only assume that there are other people in this world who are, without a doubt, their own worst critic in nearly every possible way.

It saddens me.

It cuts me deep.

Because I’ve not only inflicted this expectation onto other people in my life, 

I’ve been enacting this Self-Flagellation the entire time. 

(Chances are, and i’m willing to bet, that you do too)

On some level we are a disappointment to ourselves.

It is my view that this is a program installed onto us.

Not something that is organically present within Humans and I have one specific example which completely trumps this:

Children.

Children are the ultimate sages in this reality.

Infants are born into a universe unlike the one experienced in the womb, quickly acclimating to the environment, enacting faith in those that will tend for it, and begin the arduous task of replicating the behavior of those around them in order to survive.

Once, this initial stage is complete, they begin to fathom social cues, timing, and begin to differentiate ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ language used in proximity.

We are born with only two fears as humans:

1.  Heights / Being Dropped

2.  Sudden / Loud Noise

Other than those two, all other fears that develop are the result of the nature of how you were nurtured. (See what i did there?)

What does all of this mean?

Well, it boils down to this:

You are the only person who is truly aware of the purpose and capabilities of you.

And this is exactly why there are so many tools at play to keep you from remembering this ultimate truth.

You came here to change your reality.

You are a catalyst of change for those who interact with you.

But the prerequisite is the attention required to refine yourself as an individual.

Did I really get all of this from a 15 minute meditation?

Yes.

Most of this entire email are new connections to older ideas which were not as cohesively formed as before.

I’m going to be quite honest and even say that was the first meditation i’ve done in a while, before today.

I awoke with the intention to meditate, and it’s now happened twice.

My focus is sharp.

My mind is set.

I know my intent.

And now I have to get to work.

So i’ll end with this simple thought:

Are you the programmer, or just the ‘execute’ file?

You are strong.

You are free.

You are loved.

Thank you for reading,

Your friend,

Victor V.
