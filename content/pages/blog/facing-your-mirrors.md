**Reflect or Shun

Yesterday, my good friend Ciara and I decided to go on a hike. It’s a local mountain with a couple of cool waterfalls at the top. Having not been there before, I decided it would be a good time.

Incidentally, I happened to have about an eighth of shrooms on me, stale from poor storage, and not yet made into microdoses because I was lazy about filling my own pills.

It just so happened that she had a couple of grams as well, we hadn’t planned it, but we decided to dose these shrooms through my favorite method: Lemon Tek.

For those who are not aware, this is the process of adding lemon juice (or other high acidity juice) to chopped / ground Psilocybin mushrooms in order to change the the active compound into 4-MeO DMT.

That’s not the exact same thing as typical ‘DMT’ (5-MeO) but it provides a different come up, often more powerful peak. revelations, and a smoother come-down with much less nausea than traditional consumption.

We consecrated our journey with a brief prayer for protection and guidance, and drank / chewed the concoctions.

And began climbing up the ravine into the tree line.

It must have been at least 100 degrees outside, even with the higher elevation and wind that was blowing.

About 20 minutes in, I start to notice the first affects, a noticeable change in my breathing patterns.

Another 20 minutes go by, and we’ve made it to the first ‘peak’, the lowest waterfall glistening in the bright sunlight. Laughter erupting off the rocks as people swam in the watering hole.

Ciara and I take a seat on an adjacent path, in the dirt.


Once I start to feel the shrooms kick in I plant myself and usually don’t move much.

I become still.

This was something I warned her about before we started, that I often fall into myself during a trip and become all but useless to other people.

Communication becomes difficult.

Reading social cues is even harder.

Geometric patterns start to set in between the leaves, roots, water, dirt, rocks, everything.

I make the connection that Geometry is where Earth (Geo) Me(ets) Tree. Or that i’m the bridge between Earth and Trees, i’m not sure. But it was very interesting to say the least.

The journey continues deeper. 

My mirrors are starting to arise, I’ve seen all my mistakes laid out before since my last shroom trip, a remembrance to the promises I had forgotten about, the patterns I had yet to break, and facing the hardest question i’ve ever asked myself:

Who am I?

Am I the person who does things? Do I create? Produce? Do i exist to breathe, defecate, and sweat? 

Was money important to me? Possessions? Did I need them to live, to breathe?!

I was sitting in dirt and the pestering mosquitoes were making my blood their feast.

Bothered, but unwavered, I travel deeper into the parts of myself I have been avoiding over the last year.

Was I a manipulator? A chameleon? What parts of my ‘persona’ were actually mine? How original is any entity? Am I acting with the best intentions for others or was I a constant manipulator? Am I the one being manipulated by others?

How much influence do I truly hold?

Ciara is fluctuating between laughter and tears. I repeatedly ask if she was ‘okay’.

I didn’t know what I meant, but I knew the last time I took someone on a trip I left them behind to fend for themselves.

She was likely annoyed by the amount of times I asked her that in between long stretches of complete silence.

It must have been an hour or two of sitting, with the occasional word exchange between us.

Mostly about work situations, stuff she’s dealing with, the weight that’s on her shoulders.

Soon she was facing parts of herself that were uncomfortable, she began looking for a way out.

Words were said about my father, then about me, in arrangements I’d never heard before described to me by a person who’s known all but for 2 months.

“Fuck your dad. He’s powerful. He’s messing with me! He’s messing with YOU.”

“Is he? I don’t think about him. He has no power of me.”

My reluctance to share in these sentiments did not go over lightly.

Each time a projection was cast onto me, I’d ask, “Is that your perception or mine?”

She was looking for reassurance that I could not offer. Because I am not her. Her experience is her own, and I’d have no way to bridge that gap between what she’s going through and what I assume.

This exact situation, was a repetition of the times i’d be roped into other tantrums, then became the scapegoat for.

I keep my silence and continue to breathe as the tessellations are still taunting me.

My behavior struck a nerve with her because the trip was leading us deeper into these woods, although we weren’t moving. 

We were following the white rabbit and nothing looked the same.

“Victor, what are you doing? Why are you doing this?” she was scared. She was starting to lose herself.

I rose from my seated position and stood.

“I am standing. I’m not doing anything.”

It is very likely that I was condescending while speaking, I’m not too aware of my tone at this point.

I’m over here dealing with my own ego, doubts, patterns, and battles, while being yelled at by a person experiencing the same thing. A person claiming to know my parents better than myself (while I learn later this was a deflection from her internal battle with her parents.)

“FUCK YOU.  Why are you doing this?! I’m gonna FIGHT you!”

I remain poised, “I don’t fight. Don’t do that.”

There were more to these exchanges, tensions rose for about 30 minutes.

“I want to go back, let’s go back to before this,” she pleaded.

“There is no back, perception is tricky, locality is tricky,” I offered. Not really sure what I was trying to say. But there’s no un-learning the truth, especially when it’s personal and isn’t pretty.

Before both of our eyes the environment around us changed again.

The waterfall looked different, the arrangements of rocks and trees had changed.

The path was gone.

“Take us back. I want to leave this place.”

So I volunteered to lead the way, still in my stupor from the mushrooms and dealing with my internal voice of doubt, decay, and unworthiness.

Have I left an impact on this world? Was I really capable of the things I claim?

Am I being true to myself? Am I utilizing my full potential?

Time is the only resource available, and you’re WASTING IT.

Are you sure you’re not going to fail?

These questions circled my head as I began leading us in near circles.

“We need to go down, and out. Follow the water.”

I repeated this a number of times as I tried to keep my bearings.

No compass, no maps, no phone. Just me, my memory, and the ability to tell direction based on the celestial patterns in the sky.

Had I deceived her? Was I toying with her? Or myself? Did I know the way or assume to know the way? What WAS my intention with this all? Have I betrayed the trust of another human? Was I hurt? Did I hurt her?

It didn’t matter. She was beginning to panic and this wasn’t the time to doubt.

I began to lead us back to the car. We happened upon an old woman who was seemingly lost.

“Can’t find the path...? Do you know where to go?”

I offered so much as a shrug and kept moving down and out, away from the peaks, away from this entity that drew us in and up.

That lady also became a distant memory. Children were crying. It was still hot, people were lost.

There was fear in the air.

We have to get away from the mountain.

It’s time to go home.

What is a home? Is it where you rest? Where you shower? Was I already home?

Aren’t I alive? Am I still breathing?

These questions were burning inside my head as the sun burned against my skin.

“Do you know where you’re going???”

“Yes. I know the way.”

Or so I said. It didn’t matter if it was true. It was going to happen.

There was no amount of doubt that was going to infect my determination.

After what seemed like 45 minutes of descent, we finally reach the same ravine we had traversed a few hours earlier.

“Does this look familiar yet?” I taunted.

I knew, I knew the way.

As the peak of our trip drew to a close, and our trip drew away from the peak, toward the car, i shouted,

“WELL. We made it.”

I was half proud and half surprised.

There was a sigh of relief.

Then the clarity began to rush in.

I started to innerstand the relationship of void and duality.

Masculine + Feminine / Inner-Child

Saturn + Gaia / Sol

Electricity + Magnetism / Gravity

Length + Width / Depth

Destruction + Creation / Beauty

It just started to click.

I began to explain myself to Ciara.

It was a lot for her to take in.

Toeing the balance between these forces is what creates a powerful being within this realm.

The ‘knowing’ vs ‘thinking’.

Perceiving vs Judgement

“Do you get it yet?” I remember repeating numerous times, definitely coming off like an asshole.

But it was so blatantly obvious I couldn’t tip toe around it anymore.

“The mind thinks. The heart knows.”

I could see the wheels turning in her head, I tried one more approach as we stopped in a random neighborhood.

“Men THINK they have power, but women KNOW they do.

Men destroy, women create.

LOVE or HATE.

The power lies within.

THAT’S a GOD.

WILL-FULL CREATION in spite of the ability to DESTROY.”

She was beginning to innerstand.

The house number across the street was 1212.

We were only a mile from my house, but once again, assumed we were lost in some neighborhood.

This energetic exchange was one that I will never forget.

The transformation was so powerful it’s near beyond language.

We left and returned. Visited wonderland. And I was the mad hatter.

The mirror.

The shapeshifter.

One who knows his power and chooses gentleness.

One who can destroy and chooses to heal.

One who has experience hardship, heartache, and chooses LOVE.

I am all that ever was, ever will be.

Truth, void, light, dark, good, evil.

All is mental.

And I’m a little mental too.

I change people and it upsets them.

I am a mirror.

But it wasn’t until I faced my own reflection, over and over and over and over.

Through ex-lovers, my parents, best friends, and developing relationships.

With each interaction of any other person on this planet.

I am nothing more than the impact I leave onto others.

I am you.

We are love.

It’s always all love, in all ways.

There is no past, no future.

There is only now. Our presen[ts]ce.

Thank you for reading.

Talk again soon.
