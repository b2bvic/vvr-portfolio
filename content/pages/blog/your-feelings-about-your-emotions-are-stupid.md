There’s an amount of time between your reaction to a situation, and your reaction to your reaction.

If you don’t know what I mean, I’ll explain.

Growing up, I was taught that you should always take the environment at face value. You do this to become familiar with your surroundings on the off-chance that _something_ happens that will be outside of your control.

**That’s just the nature of reality.**
In order to mitigate this, take in as much information about your environment (internal & external) as possible **WITHOUT** allowing yourself to get ‘caught up’ in your **FEELINGS** about it.

I use this example all the time:

Say you’re in traffic and someone cuts you off…

1.  _There’s the initial reaction & response_
2.  _You move out of the way_
3.  _Crisis Averted_

But then, most times, there’s a second response:

1.  _“THIS fuckin’ guy must be in a hurry”_
2.  _Maybe your brow furrows_
3.  _Situation festers in your mind & is dragged throughout the day_

**Why is that though?**
Why is it so appealing for people to carry with them the reactions that already-adequately served their purpose?

You felt the emotion, yes? Then why are you still holding it?

Some people call this disassociation, I think of it more like ‘emptying the emotional cache’ & moving on with your life.

These lessons were imparted from my teenage parents.

Some of it explicitly, like my dad teaching me to visualize a goal before attempting an action.

Some of it implicitly, like my mom single-handedly raising two children, while putting herself through school, working double-shifts for years on end.

The preparation your parents lay down for you is your burden to bear. If they didn’t do that at all, then you still have the example (just inverted.)

Don’t be the person who allows their circumstances to define them.

Thank you for reading,
